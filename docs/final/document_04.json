Term; Commencement Date.\n\nThe Term of this Lease shall commence on the Commencement Date as set forth in Section 1.01 (G). Within thirty (30) days after request by Landlord, Tenant shall enter into a supplemental agreement prepared by Landlord which affirms the Commencement Date and the expiration date of the Initial Term of the Lease as well as other basic lease provisions substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F (the \"Commencement Date Agreement\").

Renewal Terms.\n\nProvided Tenant is continuously open and operating its business and has not been in default under this Lease beyond any applicable cure period, Tenant may extend the Term of this Lease for periods of time described in Section 1.01(H) (each a \"Renewal Term” and collectively, the \"Renewal Terms\").

Method of Floor Area Measurement.\n\nFor purposes of this Lease the term “GLA” shall mean: (a) with respect to the Premises, the actual number of square feet of floor space within the Premises, measured from the center line of interior partitions and from the outside exterior wall faces, without deduction or exclusion for any space occupied by or used for columns, stairs, hallways or other interior construction or equipment, and (b) with respect to the Shopping Center or any particular part thereof, shall mean the aggregate total gross leasable area of all buildings within the Shopping Center (excluding all basement, mezzanine, vestibule and storage areas). Exact GLA of the Premises shall be determined by Landlord. In the event that Landlord determines that the GLA in the Premises is more or less than the GLA stated in Section 1.01(E), the Minimum Rent shall be adjusted, by adding thereto or subtracting therefrom, an amount equal to the product of the number of “as-measured\" square foot difference in the Premises multiplied by the rate per leasable square foot stated in Section 1.01(J) applicable for each Lease Year.\n\n## SECTION 1.08. Lease Year; Calendar Year.\n\nFor purposes of this Lease, the term \"Lease Year\" shall mean, for the first (1st) such Lease Year, the period beginning on the Commencement Date and ending at the end of the fifteenth (15th) full calendar month to elapse therefrom, and thereafter shall mean each successive period of twelve (12) consecutive calendar months during the Term.\n\nFor purposes of this Lease, the term “calendar year\" shall mean each successive January 1 to December 31 period falling within the Term. The periods from: (a) the Commencement Date to the end of the calendar year in which Commencement Date occurs, and (b) from January 1st of the calendar year in which the Term ends until the date on which the Term ends, shall be considered \"partial calendar years.\" Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the words \"calendar year\" shall be deemed wherever used to include any partial calendar years that may fall within the Term.\n\n## ARTICLE II - RENT\n\n## SECTION 2.01. Definition and Payment of Rent.\n\nThe term \"Rent\" or \"rent\" shall mean all monies due from Tenant to Landlord hereunder and shall be paid to Landlord on the first day of each month without demand, deductions or set-offs. All Rent required to be paid by Tenant under this Lease other than Minimum Rent shall be regarded to be \"Additional Rent\" or \"additional rent.\" Unless otherwise specified herein, Additional Rent shall be paid within ten (10) days following rendering of invoice.\n\n## SECTION 2.02. Annual Minimum Rent.\n\nTenant hereby covenants and agrees to pay to Landlord Minimum Rent each Lease Year, beginning upon the Commencement Date at Landlord's Address for Payments (as set forth in Section 1.01(A)) or such other place as Landlord may from time to time designate. Minimum Rent shall be paid in equal consecutive monthly installments on or before the first day of each month during the Term. Rent shall be paid in currency of the United States of America. In the event of a partial calendar month, Rent shall be prorated accordingly. Landlord shall have the right to impose a returned check fee in the amount of Fifty Dollars ($50) in addition to any applicable late charge, for any check that is returned for insufficient funds, and to thereafter require payment by cashier's check.\n\nAnnual Minimum Rent has been computed at the respective rates per Lease Year per square foot of GLA in the Premises as stated in Section 1.01(E) hereof.\n\n## SECTION 2.02(A). Minimum Rent Abatement.\n\nProvided Tenant is not in default under this Lease beyond any applicable cure period, commencing on the Commencement Date, the first ninety (90) days of Minimum Rent payable under this Lease shall be abated. Tenant shall pay all items of Additional Rent, including, but not limited to, the Common Area Maintenance Costs, Real Estate Taxes, and Insurance components of Additional Rent commencing on the Commencement Date. Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, if this Lease is terminated pursuant to the provisions of Section 17.02 for non- payment of Rent (an Event of Default) this rent abatement shall be deemed revoked and Tenant shall be liable for all such Rent.\n\n## SECTION 2.03.

Tenant shall obtain, at Tenant's sole cost and expense, all permits, certificates and approvals (including, but not limited to, any approvals required by any existing owners' association) that may be necessary for the performance of Tenant's Work so that a final unconditional certificate of occupancy for the Premises may be issued. Copies of all necessary approvals and permits shall be delivered to Landlord prior to Tenant commencing Tenant's Work. Upon the issuance of a certificate of occupancy (temporary or permanent), or such other documentation as may be provided by the applicable jurisdiction, a copy thereof shall be immediately delivered to Landlord. Landlord recognizes that Tenant's Permitted Use may require, from time to time, commercially reasonable noises audible within the interior of the Premises due to television, music, and/or microphone usage. Tenant's plans and specifications will include provisions for such sound-proofing, additional support or other measures as are reasonably appropriate to mitigate noise produced within the Premises so that it is not audible outside of the Premises, and Landlord will have the right to approve such measures, such approval not tбo be unreasonably withheld.

All Improvements shall be made at Tenant's sole cost and expense.\n\nAll Improvements made by Tenant, including but not limited to heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment, hot water heater(s) and bathroom fixtures, which have become an integral part of the Premises, shall be deemed the property of Landlord at the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease, regardless of whether originally installed by Landlord or by Tenant, and such Improvements may not be removed by Tenant at any time during the Term unless they are replaced by comparable Improvements, in new or like new condition. Upon expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant shall not remove any of such Improvements.

Personal property and trade fixtures belonging to Tenant shall remain the property of Tenant and shall be removed by Tenant in accordance with Section 11.01.\n\n## SECTION 3.04.

Upon vacating the Premises, unless Landlord otherwise directs to Tenant, Tenant agrees to remove all such awnings and signs and to repair all damage, to Landlord's reasonable satisfaction, caused by such removal. In the event Tenant fails to remove its awnings and/or signage or to repair all damage caused thereby within five (5) days after vacating the Premises, Landlord may do so and, within ten (10) days after Tenant's receipt of invoice therefor, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for Landlord's costs and expenses incurred in connection with the removal of Tenant's signs and/or repairs required in relation thereto, together with an administrative fee not to exceed fifteen percent (15%) (the amount of such reimbursement and administrative fee, the \"Signage Removal Fee\"). Alternatively, Landlord may deduct the Signage Removal Fee from Tenant's Security Deposit. Tenant hereby consents to Landlord's display of Tenant's logos in its marketing materials and website.\n\nAll of the foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, subject to Legal Requirements and Landlord's prior approval, Tenant shall be permitted to cover up to thirty percent (30%) of the Premises' windows with opaque film and/or \"Orangetheory Fitness\" graphics approved by Orangetheory Fitness. In addition, Landlord hereby approves the aesthetic design of Tenant's prototype sign as depicted on the drawings on Exhibit C-1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to installing its storefront signage, Tenant shall submit to Landlord Premises-specific drawings of Tenant's storefront sign design, construction, and method of attachment to the building façade for Landlord's review and approval.\n\nFrom the Effective Date of this Lease through that date which is sixty (60) days following Tenant's opening of the Premises for business to the public, Tenant shall be permitted to hang a professionally prepared, Landlord approved \"Opening Soon,\" \"Grand Opening, \"Now Open\" or similar banner on the exterior of the Premises. Prior to hanging, the design, content and method of attachment to the building for such banner shall be presented to and approved by Landlord.

Mechanic's Liens.\n\nTenant shall not permit any lien, encumbrance or charge arising out of any work performed or materials furnished by any contractor, mechanic, laborer, or materialman for or at the request of Tenant to be attached or recorded against the Premises or any other portion of the Shopping Center. If any lien or notice of lien on account of an alleged debt of Tenant or any notice of contract by a party engaged by Tenant or Tenant's contractor to work on the Premises is filed against the Premises or any part of the Shopping Center, Tenant will, within fifteen (15) days after notice of the filing thereof, cause the same to be discharged of record by payment, deposit, bond, or order of a court of competent jurisdiction. Tenant shall, within three (3) days thereafter, provide Landlord with a copy of the entry of the court approving the bond, or other written evidence reasonably satisfactory to Landlord that such lien has been otherwise discharged. Furthermore, in the event that any action on the lien has been or is commenced, Tenant shall undertake any and all legal procedures necessary to accomplish termination of such action. If Tenant fails to cause such lien or notice of lien to be discharged within such period, Landlord may, but shall not be obligated to, discharge the same either by paying the amounts claimed to be due or by procuring the discharge of such lien by deposit, bond or otherwise, and Tenant shall, immediately upon demand, reimburse Landlord for all costs and expenses incurred by Landlord to discharge such lien including, without limitation, all attorneys' fees and, court costs, plus an administrative fee equal to fifteen percent (15%) of all expenses and costs incurred by Landlord. In addition, Tenant shall indemnify and hold Landlord and Landlord's lender, if any, harmless from and against all loss, cost, expense and liability whatsoever (including Landlord's cost of defending against the foregoing, such cost to include attorneys' fees) resulting or occurring by reason of any claims or causes of actions that may arise as a result of any lien, notice of lien or, claim relating to work and/or materials furnished to the Premises at the request of Tenant, its employees, agents or contractors.\n\n## SECTION 3.07. Landlord Not Liable For Plan Approvals.\n\nLandlord shall not be liable for any approval given with respect to any plans, specifications, materials, or contractors of Tenant. Tenant agrees and acknowledges Landlord's review of any plans or specifications is for the limited purpose of evaluating conformity to architectural standards and allocation of construction responsibilities between Landlord and Tenant, and that no approval by Landlord of any Tenant's plans, specifications, materials, contractors or the like constitutes a representation, warranty or opinion by Landlord as to the compliance thereof with Legal Requirements.\n\n## SECTION 3.08. Grease Containment.\n\nIf the Premises is used as a restaurant, Tenant shall install a grease trap, and if required by Landlord, a rooftop grease containment system, such as Grease Guard® or a similar product approved by Landlord.

Satisfactory evidence shall include contracts with, or invoices from, a qualified grease containment system servicer detailing the type of services provided and the dates for such services. Tenant shall maintain service records at the Premises for at least two (2) years. Tenant shall be liable for all costs and expenses arising from clogging, stoppage, breakage, damage to, or destruction of the Premises or another tenant's premises, or the fixtures, property, or equipment therein, resulting from Tenant's failure to properly install or maintain the grease trap, grease containment system, exhaust hoods (including related ductwork) in accordance with this Lease.\n\n## ARTICLE IV - RELOCATION AND REMODEL\n\n## SECTION 4.01. Relocation.\n\nIf Landlord elects to: (a) add a new tenant to, (b) relocate or expand a then existing tenant within, or (c) otherwise remodel, expand, reduce or reconfigure the Shopping Center (the \"Redeveloped Shopping Center”), then Landlord shall have the right to relocate Tenant to other available space in the Redeveloped Shopping Center, which space shall have at least ninety percent (90%) but no more than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the GLA of the Premises (\"Substitute Premises\"). Within thirty (30) days of Tenant's receipt of Landlord's written notice designating one or more Substitute Premises, Tenant shall, by written notice to Landlord, accept or reject the Substitute Premises.\n\nIf Tenant accepts the Substitute Premises then, within thirty (30) days from Tenant's acceptance, Landlord and Tenant shall execute an amendment to this Lease or a new lease evidencing such agreement and containing all other provisions of this Lease. The amount of Minimum Rent and Additional Rent per square foot as set forth in Section 1.01 shall apply to the Substitute Premises. Thereafter, Landlord shall pay all reasonable costs to move Tenant's then-existing equipment, trade fixtures, inventory and personal property to the Substitute Premises.\n\nIf no Substitute Premises is available within the Redeveloped Shopping Center, Tenant rejects the Substitute Premises, or Tenant fails to respond to Landlord's notice or execute an amendment or new lease within the timeframes set forth above, then Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease on at least sixty (60) days' advance written notice to Tenant.

Prior to the start of construction, Tenant shall submit detailed plans of the proposed construction for Landlord's written approval. Additionally, Tenant shall install new awnings and/or signs in conformity with new sign criteria developed in conjunction with such remodeling work, if any. Detailed specifications for such awnings or signs shall be submitted for Landlord's written approval prior to installation, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at the time of completion of such work, there is less than twelve (12) months remaining in the Term and such Term is not renewed, Tenant shall not be required to remodel Tenant's Trade Dress, but shall be required to install a new awning and/or sign in accordance with this Section.\n\n## ARTICLE V - CONDUCT OF BUSINESS BY TENANT\n\n## SECTION 5.01. Use of Premises and Trade Name.\n\nSubject to the Prohibited Uses set forth on Exhibit D and Exhibit D-1 attached hereto and incorporated herein and any existing exclusives and other use restrictions contained in existing leases or otherwise applicable to the Shopping Center, the Premises shall be used for the Permitted Use as specified in Section 1.01(B) and no other use without the prior written consent of Landlord, which may be withheld in Landlord's sole and absolute discretion. As of the Commencement Date, the Premises shall be operated under the Trade Name specified in Section 1.01(C) and under no other Trade Name whatsoever without the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any change of the Permitted Use, if approved by Landlord, must comply with any and all then-existing exclusive provisions of the other tenants of the Shopping Center. Tenant agrees to occupy and operate in all of the Premises and commence its business and operations within one hundred twenty (120) days following the Date of Delivery of this Lease and thereafter continuously conduct business fully staffed to maximize sales from the Premises.\n\n## SECTION 5.02. Operation of Business.\n\nTenant shall keep all the Premises continuously and uninterruptedly open for business to the public during the Minimum Hours of Operation set forth in Section 1.01(R).

Tenant agrees to comply with and observe all rules and regulations set forth on Exhibit E attached hereto and such additional reasonable, non-discriminatory written rules and regulations and modifications thereto which Landlord may promulgate from time to time. If, in Landlord's reasonable judgment, Tenant's business operations result in an increase of criminal activity, or other disturbances within the Shopping Center arising from Tenant's business are excessive to other tenants, customers and invitees of the Shopping Center, Landlord may require Tenant to hire off-duty police officers or security personnel from a security company acceptable to Landlord, as Landlord may determine, to maintain quiet and order. Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold Landlord harmless from any claims and liability arising out of any acts or misconduct of any such personnel or officers Tenant may retain.\n\nThe provisions of this Section 5.02 are intended solely for the benefit of Landlord and are not intended for the benefit of any other tenant of the Shopping Center. No other tenant of the Shopping Center shall have the right to enforce or cause Landlord to enforce the provisions hereof; nor shall Tenant have the right to enforce or cause Landlord to enforce this or any similar provision in any other lease for space in the Shopping Center.\n\nBecause of the difficulty or impossibility of determining Landlord's damages by way of loss of the anticipated percentage rent from other tenants or occupants of the Shopping Center, or by way of loss of value of the Shopping Center because of diminished marketability or Landlord's ability to finance the Shopping Center or adverse publicity or appearance by Tenant's action, should Tenant (a) fail to take possession of and open for business in the entire Premises fully-fixtured, stocked and staffed on the Commencement Date, or (b) abandon, leave vacant or desert the Premises, or any part thereof or (c) fail to continuously operate or conduct Tenant's business in accordance with the terms of this Section 5.02 for the Permitted Use, or (d) fail or refuse to remain open during the Minimum Hours of Operation or any part thereof, or (e) fail to operate under the Trade Name, then and in any of such events (hereinafter collectively referred to as \"failure to do business\"), Landlord shall have the right, in addition to any and all other rights or remedies Landlord may have under this Lease, or at law or in equity, at Landlord's option, in addition to Tenant's existing rental obligations hereunder (i) to collect Additional Rent equal to fifty percent (50%) of the amount of Minimum Rent reserved for the period of Tenant's failure to do business computed at a daily rate for each and every day or part thereof during such period (such Additional Rent shall be deemed to be liquidated damages in lieu of the damage to the business operations and value of the Shopping Center) and, in addition, at Landlord's option, (ii) to treat such failure to do business as an Event of Default by Tenant under Article XVII. Notwithstanding any provision of this Lease to the contrary, Tenant may close for business for such reasonable times as may be necessary to perform: (A) a remodeling or rebuilding of the Premises which has been approved by Landlord as set forth herein; (B) up to five (5) days in any calendar year for maintenance and repairs to the Premises; and (C) up to two (2) days in each calendar year to conduct an inventory.\n\n## SECTION 5.03. Radius Restriction.\n\nTenant agrees during the Term, Tenant shall not, within the Radius Restriction Area set forth in Section 1.01(P), either directly or indirectly, by itself or with others, own, operate, franchise, license, or be otherwise financially interested in a business or location like or similar to the business permitted to be conducted under this Lease. In the event of a failure by Tenant to comply with this Section 5.03, Landlord shall, in addition to all other rights and remedies available to Landlord, at its option: (a) obtain an injunction against the operation of such other\n\n8\n\nG:\\Leases\\Andrea\\Winchester Square\\Orangetheory Fitness\\Lease v.5 11-17-17.docx\n\nCASTO\nLEGAL\nDEPT.\n\nbusiness or location; and/or (b) require Minimum Rent payable hereunder to increase by twenty-five percent (25%) for the period of such violation.\n\n## SECTION 5.04. Soundproofing.\n\nLandlord recognizes that Tenant's use may require, from time to time, commercially reasonable noises within the interior of the Premises due to television, music and/or microphone usage. Tenant's plans and specifications will include provisions for such sound-proofing, additional support or other measures as it deems appropriate to address noise produced within the Premises and Landlord shall have the reasonable right to approve such measures in accordance with the procedures for Landlord's approval of Tenant's plans set forth in Section III of Exhibit B. Tenant shall, as part of Tenant's Work, install, at its sole cost, the sound-proofing in accordance with Tenant's Plans (defined in Section III of Exhibit B). In the event Landlord requires any further sound-proofing measures beyond that which was installed per Tenant's Plans, Landlord shall have the right, at Landlord's expense and with Tenant's cooperation, to install such additional sound-proofing measures.\n\n## ARTICLE VI - UTILITIES AND TRASH REMOVAL\n\n## SECTION 6.01. Utilities Generally.\n\nTenant shall be solely responsible for contracting for and shall promptly pay all charges for all utilities or services used in, or specifically attributable to, the Premises from and after the date on which Tenant first gains possession thereof, together with all taxes, levies or other charges based on the use of such utilities, including any tap- in fees and/or impact fees and/or deposits. Tenant shall not, in the absence of Landlord's prior written consent or direction, have any utility service discontinued in its name prior to the last day of the Term or any later date on which any month-to-month tenancy shall end. Landlord shall have the option to pay any past due amounts owed by Tenant to any utility provider and Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for any such amount, plus an administrative fee of fifteen percent (15%) of the total cost thereof, as Additional Rent. Should Landlord elect to directly supply any such utility or service used or consumed in the Premises, the same shall be supplied to Tenant at a rate not to exceed the rate Tenant would pay if Tenant contracted directly with the local utility provider. Tenant agrees to reimburse Landlord for such service as Additional Rent.\n\nLandlord shall have the right at any time, and from time to time during the Term, either to contract for service from a different company or companies providing electric service or gas service or other utilities or to continue to contract for service from the service provider currently providing service (each a \"Utility Service Provider\"). In conjunction therewith, Tenant shall cooperate with Landlord and Utility Service Provider at all times and, as reasonably necessary, shall allow Landlord and/or Utility Service Provider reasonable access to electric lines, feeders, risers, wiring, plumbing lines, and any other machinery or equipment located within the Premises. Landlord shall not be liable for any loss, damage, or expense Tenant may incur or sustain by reason of any change, failure, interference, disruption, or defect in the supply or character of any utility service furnished to the Premises, or if the quantity or character of the utility service supplied by Utility Service Provider is no longer available or suitable for Tenant's requirements, and no such change, failure, defect, unavailability, or unsuitability shall constitute an actual or constructive eviction, in whole or in part, or entitle Tenant to any abatement or diminution of Rent, or relieve Tenant from any of its obligations under the Lease.\n\n## SECTION 6.02. Trash Removal; Sanitation.\n\nTenant, at Tenant's expense, shall at all times keep the Premises (and the sidewalks and service areas adjacent to the Premises, display windows, storefront and signs) orderly, neat, safe, clean and free from vermin, rubbish, ice and snow, and shall store all trash and other solid waste within the Premises or in dumpsters and/or trash compactors designated by Landlord. Tenant shall not permit garbage in said dumpsters/compactors to accumulate or overflow. Dumpsters/compactors shall be maintained in a reasonably clean condition. If Landlord shall provide or contract for any services or facilities for trash removal (or any part thereof), then Tenant shall be obligated to use the same, and shall pay to Landlord or Landlord's Contractor, or directly to the service provider contracted by Landlord, as the case may be, its share (as reasonably determined by Landlord and/or such service provider) of all expenses associated with such trash removal, including sales tax (if any), on a monthly basis in advance as Additional Rent. If Landlord does not provide such services, Tenant shall arrange for the regular pickup of all solid waste at Tenant's expense in a manner and upon a frequency acceptable to Landlord in its reasonable discretion. Tenant's dumpster and/or trash compactor shall be a size and in a location designated by Landlord. If requested by Landlord or if required by local zoning ordinances, Tenant shall screen or otherwise enclose Tenant's dumpster/compactor. Landlord shall not be obligated but shall have the right to remove any solid waste generated by Tenant; if Tenant fails to do so within two (2) days following notice, the costs thereof shall be paid by Tenant upon demand, plus an administrative fee of fifteen percent (15%) of such costs. Tenant shall comply with all recycling programs mandated by Legal Requirements. Tenant shall pay all penalties or damages that may be imposed on Landlord or Tenant by reason of Tenant's failure to comply with the provisions of this Section 6.02.\n\n## ARTICLE VII - TAXES\n\n## SECTION 7.01. Real Estate Taxes Defined.\n\nLandlord shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Real Estate Taxes applicable to the Shopping Center. \"Real Estate Taxes\" as used herein shall mean all taxes and assessments (special or otherwise) levied or assessed directly or indirectly against the Shopping Center and other taxes arising out of the use and/or occupancy of the Shopping Center, imposed by any taxing authority having jurisdiction over the Shopping Center, including service payments in lieu of real property taxes, and shall include expenses and reasonable attorney's fees incurred by Landlord in contesting the validity or amount of any such taxes or assessments or in seeking a rebate of taxes or assessments. Real Estate Taxes shall not include franchise, capital stock, income, estate or inheritance taxes.\n\n9\n\nG:\\Leases\\Andrea\\Winchester Square\\Orangetheory Fitness\\Lease v.5 11-17-17.docx\n\nCASTO\nLAGAL\nDEPT.\n\n## SECTION 7.02. Tenant's Share of Real Estate Taxes.\n\nCommencing upon the Commencement Date, Tenant shall pay the Initial Base Real Estate Tax Cost set forth in Section 1.01(N), which amount shall be paid in equal monthly installments due on the first day of each month. In the event that Tenant's Proportionate Share of Real Estate Taxes for any real estate tax year shall exceed the Initial Base Real Estate Tax Cost, whether by reason of an increase in either the tax rate or the assessed valuation, or by reason of a levy, assessment, or imposition of any tax or assessment of any kind on real estate or rentals, or for any other reason, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the amount of such excess as Additional Rent. In the event that the amount paid by Tenant as Tenant's contribution towards Landlord's cost of Real Estate Taxes for any real estate tax year shall exceed Tenant's Proportionate Share of said Real Estate Taxes, then Landlord shall, within thirty (30) days after determining Tenant's Proportionate Share, refund (or credit against the next succeeding Rent payment) any excess amount paid by Tenant. A copy of the relevant tax duplicate or a receipt evidencing payment to the taxing authority shall be deemed to be sufficient and conclusive evidence of the amount of Real Estate Taxes paid by Landlord. Landlord shall be solely responsible for any penalty due to late payment by Landlord. Tenant agrees and acknowledges that Landlord passes through Real Estate Taxes on a cash basis and calculates Tenant's Proportionate Share thereof based on the taxes actually paid in such calendar year. Therefore, despite the fact that Real Estate Taxes may be assessed against the Shopping Center six (6) months or more in arrears, Landlord uses the current tax bill to calculate each Tenant's Proportionate Share of Real Estate Taxes.\n\n## SECTION 7.03. Tenant's Taxes.\n\nTenant shall be responsible for and shall pay, prior to delinquency, any and all taxes, assessments, levies, fees and other governmental charges of every kind or nature (hereinafter collectively called \"taxes\") levied or assessed by municipal, county, state, federal or other taxing or assessing authority upon, against or with respect to: (a) the Premises or any leasehold interest therein; (b) all furniture, fixtures, equipment and any personal property of any kind owned by Tenant or any previous tenant and occupant, and placed, installed or located in, within, upon or about the Premises (collectively, \"Tenant's Property\"); (c) all alterations, additions or improvements of whatever kind or nature, if any, made to the Premises, by Tenant or any previous occupant; and (d) Rent payable by Tenant to Landlord, irrespective of whether the foregoing are assessed as real or personal property, and irrespective of whether any of such items are assessed to or against Landlord or Tenant. If at any time during the Term any of such taxes are not levied and assessed separately and directly to Tenant (for example, if the same are levied or assessed to Landlord, or upon or against the building containing the Premises and/or the land underlying said building), Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Additional Rent, Tenant's share thereof as reasonably determined by Landlord.\n\n## ARTICLE VIII - COMMON AREAS AND FACILITIES\n\n## SECTION 8.01. Definition.\n\n\"Common Areas\" shall mean all areas, spaces, facilities, equipment, directional signs, entry features and special services from time to time made available for the common and joint use and benefit of Landlord, Tenant and other tenants and occupants of the Shopping Center, including, but not limited to, sidewalks, parking areas, access roads, driveways, roofs, building facades, landscaped areas, truck service ways, loading docks, parcel pick-up areas, restrooms, fire suppression systems, bus stations, detention and retention ponds and related pipes, if any, green spaces and utility facilities as the same may from time to time be constructed and maintained for such use.\n\n## SECTION 8.02. Use.\n\nTenant shall have a nonexclusive license to use the Common Areas as now or at any time during the Term may exist, in common with Landlord and other tenants and occupants of the Shopping Center. In no event, however, shall Tenant, its agents or employees, use the Common Areas for the display or sale of merchandise, nor shall Tenant be permitted to place any signs or other marketing materials in the Common Areas, unless in conjunction with a Landlord authorized event or program. The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, Tenant's use of any Common Areas shall be subject to the Legal Requirements.\n\n## SECTION 8.03. Control of Common Areas by Landlord.\n\nAs between Landlord and Tenant, Landlord shall control and manage the Common Areas. Landlord shall, at all times, have full control over the layout and extent of said Common Areas and facilities, and the right, at any time, to change the location, shape, height, size, nature and configuration of stores and buildings, to locate and construct thereon kiosks, additional buildings and improvements of any type, to make alterations or additions, to build additional stories on, and to expand or reduce the Common Areas and/or Shopping Center. Landlord shall also have the right to construct multi-deck or elevated parking facilities, and/or relocate, reconfigure or change the size, arrangement, level or location of parking areas. Landlord reserves the right, from time to time, to utilize portions of the Common Areas for advertising, shows, displays, attractions, entertainment, sales, the leasing of permanent and temporary kiosks and carts or such other uses designated by Landlord. Landlord may at any time close temporarily any Common Areas to make repairs or changes, to prevent the acquisition of public rights in such area, to discourage non-customer parking, to use areas for attendant or valet parking, and may do such other acts in and to the Common Areas as in its judgment may be desirable.\n\n## SECTION 8.04. Parking Areas.\n\nTenant shall direct its members, invitees and employees to park in the parking area designated on the Site Plan as the \"Permitted Parking Area\". Tenant is required to take reasonable steps to inform its members, invitees and employees of the Permitted Parking Area and to display notice of such Permitted Parking Area in the lobby of the Premises at all times. Tenant acknowledges that any such cars not parked in the Permitted Parking Area may be towed without prior notice. Landlord shall maintain low-level lighting of the parking areas after \"normal Shopping Center business hours\" (defined as those hours when substantially all of the tenants in the Shopping Center are open for business), and later, if Landlord deems, necessary in its reasonable discretion. In the event that any vehicle owned or operated by Tenant (including delivery vehicles) or by any of its concessionaires, or by any of their respective agents or employees: (a) is parked outside the designated employee parking areas; (b) is left standing in a drive-lane or fire-\n\n10\n\nG:\\Leases\\Andrea Winchester Square\\Orangetheory Fitness\\Lease v.5 11-17-17.docx\n\nCASTO\nLEGAL\nDEPT.\n\nlane; (c) shall be left unattended for more than twenty-four (24) consecutive hours; or (d) which is reasonably deemed by Landlord to be abandoned, then, such vehicle may be towed by Landlord at the expense of the owner of the vehicle. The parking areas shall not be used for the storage, servicing of vehicles or for the purpose of using any vehicle parked therein as an advertisement.\n\n## SECTION 8.05. Common Area Maintenance Costs.\n\nAs used herein, \"Common Area Maintenance Costs\" shall mean all costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in operating, replacing, repairing and maintaining the Shopping Center and Common Areas including without limitation, costs and expenses of every kind and nature paid or incurred in operating, equipping, securing, policing and protecting, lighting, heating, air conditioning, painting, cleaning, managing, providing utilities and other services, providing a public address system, repairing, replacing and maintaining the: (a) Common Areas; (b) any parking areas maintained for the benefit of the Shopping Center; (c) all buildings, roofs, retaining walls, entry-way features, water features and other Shopping Center Improvements; and (d) all other areas, facilities and buildings, and any and all facilities and improvements which are used in common with other tenants of the Shopping Center, or in connection with the maintenance and/or operation of, and whether located within or outside of, the Shopping Center; such costs and expenses may include but shall not be limited to providing customer services; providing security personnel and other security measures; providing and maintaining traffic signalization and controls; compliance with rules, regulations and orders of governmental authorities; personal property taxes; licensing fees and taxes; audit, professional and consulting fees and expenses; supplies; decorating and seasonal decor; supplying music; erecting, maintaining, repairing and replacing pylon and/or monument signs identifying the Shopping Center; operating attendant and valet parking, if any; enforcing the rules and regulations established for the Shopping Center; costs and lease payments for any equipment used in the operation, repair, replacement or maintenance of the Common Areas; general overhead and other costs associated with maintaining and operating a management office located on site in the Shopping Center; the total compensation and benefits (including premiums for workers' compensation or any other insurance or other retirement or employee benefits, and including all costs incurred in providing such benefits) paid to or on behalf of persons involved in the management, maintenance and operation as set forth in this Section; all dues, assessments, impositions, charges and other amounts allocable to the Shopping Center payable to any association(s) of property owners of properties which include the Shopping Center; leasing off-site parking areas for customers and employees of the tenants of the Shopping Center and of busing such employees to and from such parking areas and the Shopping Center; and an amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the total of all Common Area Maintenance Costs and Landlord's Insurance, to compensate for administration services. Any of the Common Area Maintenance Costs may be amortized over a reasonable period (but not extending beyond the useful life thereof), together with interest, and Landlord may include such amortized amount in such Common Area Maintenance Costs during the year such Common Area Maintenance Costs were incurred and subsequent years. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Landlord shall not be obligated to provide or guaranty security or otherwise police any portion of the Shopping Center.\n\nCommon Area Maintenance Costs shall not include: (i) the original cost of construction of the Common Areas, the cost of construction of new buildings in the Shopping Center or the cost of acquisition of additional land or additional buildings for the Shopping Center; (ii) amounts paid by Landlord as a result of personal injury or property damage (other than insurance deductibles) to the extent not covered by insurance proceeds; (iii) except as specifically set forth in this Section 8.05, general administrative overhead of Landlord that is not directly related to management of the Shopping Center; (iv) compensation for services rendered in connection with any other property of Landlord; (v) structural improvements or other capital improvements, except Landlord may include the cost of structural or capital improvements amortized on a straight-line basis over a five (5) year term; and (vi) costs related to procuring tenants and negotiating leases or legal expenses incurred in connection with disputes with tenants. Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, in no event shall Common Area Maintenance Costs include any amount that is duplicative in nature of any other expense to be paid by Tenant hereunder, whether as a part of Common Area Maintenance Costs, as Additional Rent or otherwise.\n\n## SECTION 8.06. Tenant's Share of Common Area Maintenance.\n\nLandlord shall estimate Tenant's Proportionate Share of Common Area Maintenance Costs on the basis of periods of twelve (12) consecutive months as designated by Landlord (currently on a calendar year basis), and beginning on the Commencement Date, Tenant shall pay one-twelfth (1/12th) of such estimate of Tenant's Proportionate Share of Common Area Maintenance Costs as Additional Rent on a monthly basis in advance together with payment of Minimum Rent. As of the Commencement Date, the Common Area Maintenance Costs shall be equal to the Initial Base Common Area Maintenance Costs amount set forth in Section 1.01(M) hereof. Landlord may revise the estimate of Initial Base Common Area Maintenance Costs from time to time and change Tenant's monthly estimated payment of Common Area Maintenance Costs accordingly. Landlord shall furnish Tenant annually with a statement of the actual Common Area Maintenance Costs. If the total amount paid by Tenant shall be less than the Tenant's Proportionate Share of Common Area Maintenance Costs for such period, Tenant shall pay to Landlord such deficiency within thirty (30) days after the furnishing of each such statement unless such deficiency exceeds Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000.00), in which case Tenant may repay such deficiency in monthly installments of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) each until paid in full; and if the total amount paid by Tenant for any year shall exceed Tenant's Proportionate Share of Common Area Maintenance Costs, such excess shall be refunded or credited against the next installment due from Tenant to Landlord under this Section provided Tenant is not delinquent in any payments due Landlord, and is not otherwise in default hereunder.\n\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, provided Tenant has not been in default hereunder (beyond any applicable notice and cure period), then for each calendar year through the end of the Initial Term, the annual increase in Tenant's Proportionate Share of Controllable Common Area Maintenance Costs shall be limited to four percent (4%) over the amount set forth in Section 1.01(M) on a cumulative basis (such limit on increases, the \"Controllable CAM Cap\"). As used in this Section 8.06, \"Controllable Common Area Maintenance Costs\" means any and all costs and expenses which are controllable by Landlord and specifically exclude insurance, utilities, trash\n\nG:\\Leases\\Andrea\\Winchester Square\\Orangetheory Fitness\\Lease v.5 11-17-17.docx\n\n11\n\nCASTO\nLEGAL\nDEPT.\n\nremoval, unanticipated capital expenditures (not in the nature of a routine or reoccurring repair or replacement), snow and ice removal and any other costs or expenses beyond Landlord's reasonable control.\n\nIf Tenant exercises one or more of its renewal options as set forth in Section 1.05 hereof, then for the calendar year in which each such Renewal Term commences, the Controllable CAM Cap shall be reset to the greater of (i) the maximum capped amount for the immediately preceding calendar year or (ii) Tenant's actual (i.e. uncapped) Proportionate Share of the Controllable Common Area Maintenance Costs for such calendar year (such greater amount, the \"Renewal Term Base Year\"). For each calendar year thereafter, through the expiration of such Renewal Term, the annual increase in Tenant's Proportionate Share of Controllable Common Area Maintenance Costs shall be limited to four percent (4%) over the Renewal Term Base Year on a cumulative basis.\n\n## SECTION 8.07. Tenant's Right to Audit Landlord's Books and Records.\n\nProvided Tenant is open and operating and is not in default of any term of this Lease and further provided that Tenant's Proportionate Share of Common Area Maintenance Costs has increased by more than twenty percent (20%) from the previous calendar year, Tenant shall have the right, once per calendar year, to audit Landlord's books and accounts relating to Tenant's Proportionate Share of the Common Area Maintenance Costs for the previous calendar year. Such audit shall be conducted at Landlord's home office or other reasonable location designated by Landlord during Landlord's normal business hours and the books and records subject to review shall be limited in scope to those for the preceding calendar year. Such audit shall be at Tenant's sole cost and expense, must be conducted by an independent certified public accounting firm that is not compensated therefor on a contingent fee basis, and shall be limited to confirming Tenant's Proportionate Share of Common Area Maintenance Costs for the immediately preceding calendar year of the Term. Such accounting firm shall be experienced in auditing shopping center records and shall be subject to Landlord's reasonable prior approval. No audit may be conducted during the following time periods: (a) ten (10) days before or after the end of a fiscal quarter, or (b) during the months of December, January or February.\n\nThe audit shall be conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Tenant and Tenant's auditor will keep confidential all books, records, agreements involving the rights provided in this Section, and the results of any audits conducted hereunder. Tenant and Tenant's auditor shall execute a reasonable confidentiality agreement confirming the foregoing. Tenant may not review any other Shopping Center leases, licenses or similar agreements with other occupants of the Shopping Center.\n\nIf such audit reveals that Landlord has overstated and collected from Tenant, as Tenant's Proportionate Share of Common Area Maintenance Costs an amount in excess of the actual amount of Tenant's Proportionate Share of Common Area Maintenance Costs, then Tenant shall furnish Landlord with a certified copy of said audit and Landlord shall thereafter promptly refund to Tenant the amount of such excess; provided, however, that in the event Landlord, in good faith, disagrees with the results reported in Tenant's audit, Landlord shall have the right, within thirty (30) days thereafter, to verify Tenant's auditor's results. If the results of Landlord's audit differ from that of Tenant's, and Landlord and Tenant cannot resolve such differences, then Landlord and Tenant shall employ a mutually acceptable independent certified public accountant to review both audits, and such results shall be binding on Landlord and Tenant. In the event Tenant should assign or sublease this Lease or any portion of the rights granted hereunder, this Section 8.07 shall be deemed null and void. For purposes of this Section, an \"audit\" shall mean any request for review, by Tenant or an agent or contractor of Tenant, of any of Landlord's books and accounts relating to Tenant's Proportionate Share of the Common Area Maintenance Costs to the extent those books and accounts are more extensive or detailed than what Landlord is otherwise obligated to provide to Tenant pursuant to Sections 7.02, 8.06, or 9.02.\n\n## ARTICLE IX - INSURANCE AND INDEMNITY\n\n## SECTION 9.01. Tenant's Insurance.\n\nTenant shall, at its sole cost and expense, commencing with the date the Premises shall be made available for Tenant's Work, procure and keep in full force and effect: (a) a commercial general liability (ISO form or equivalent) policy, including insurance against personal and advertising liability, products liability/completed operations, broad form property damages, extended bodily injury and independent contractors, assumed or contractual liability under this Lease with respect to the Premises and the operations of Tenant and any person or entity conducting business in, on or about the Premises in which the limits with respect to personal liability and property damage shall be not less than Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) per occurrence on a location basis; (b) liquor liability insurance (if alcohol is served or sold at the Premises) in an amount of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence and One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) in the aggregate; (c) property insurance, including theft and, if applicable, boiler and machinery coverage, written at replacement cost value in an adequate amount to avoid coinsurance and a replacement cost endorsement insuring Tenant's Property, plate glass (although Tenant shall be permitted to self-insure for plate glass if not available at an economically feasible rate), and signs located on or in the Premises; (d) workers' compensation coverage as required by law and employer's liability insurance in an amount of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence and One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) in the aggregate; (e) with respect to alterations, improvements and the like required or permitted to be made by Tenant hereunder, contractor's protective liability and builder's risk insurance, in amounts satisfactory to Landlord; (f) Comprehensive Automobile Liability Insurance, including the ownership, maintenance and operation of any automotive equipment owned, hired, and non-owned in the following minimum amounts with a limit of not less than Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) combined single limit for bodily injury and property damage; (g) business interruption insurance; (h) the insurance required under Exhibit B; and (i) such insurance as may from time to time be required by city, county, state or federal laws, codes, regulations or authorities. From time to time during the Term, at Landlord's request, Tenant shall: (i) procure, pay for and keep in full force and effect such other insurance as Landlord shall reasonably require; and (ii) increase the limits of such insurance as Landlord or Landlord's lender shall reasonably require.\n\n12\n\nG:\\Leases\\Andrea\\Winchester Square\\Orangetheory Fitness\\Lease v.5 11-17-17.docx\n\nCASTO\nLEGAL\nDEPT.\n\nAll Tenant's policies of insurance shall be written by an insurance company having a Best rating of at least A-/IX and licensed to do business in the state in which the Premises is located. Any such insurance required of Tenant hereunder may be furnished by Tenant under any blanket policy carried by it or under a separate policy therefor. A copy of each paid-up policy evidencing such insurance or a certificate of the insurer, certifying that such policy has been issued, shall be delivered to Landlord prior to the Commencement Date and, upon renewals, not less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of such coverage. Landlord may, at any time, and from time to time, inspect and/or copy any and all insurance policies required to be procured by Tenant hereunder.\n\nEach policy evidencing insurance required to be carried by Tenant pursuant to this Section shall contain the following provisions and/or clauses: (A) a cross liability, severability or substantially similar clause; (B) that such policy shall be primary and noncontributing with respect to any policies carried by Landlord, and that any coverage carried by Landlord shall be excess insurance; (C) name Landlord and any other parties in interest designated by Landlord as an additional insured (except with respect to workers' compensation insurance); and (D) that the insurer will not cancel, materially change or fail to renew the coverage provided by such policy without first giving Landlord at least ten (10) days' prior written notice.\n\n## SECTION 9.02. Landlord's Insurance.\n\nLandlord agrees to carry insurance covering the Shopping Center and Landlord's buildings and improvements therein against perils or loss and insurance for such other risks that Landlord or Landlord's lender may elect or be required to carry, including, but not limited to, rent insurance, wind insurance and/or flood insurance, and in an amount or amounts as Landlord or Landlord's lender may deem appropriate. Landlord shall also carry and maintain such coverage for liability arising from the Common Areas of the Shopping Center including umbrella and environmental coverage, as Landlord deems appropriate (collectively, \"Landlord's Insurance\").\n\nBeginning on the Commencement Date, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, an annual amount equal to the Initial Base Insurance Cost set forth in Section 1.01(O) herein, which amount shall be paid in equal monthly installments due on the first day of each calendar month. In the event that in any year, Tenant's Proportionate Share of Landlord's Insurance shall exceed the Initial Base Insurance Cost, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, the amount of such deficiency. In the event that the amount paid by Tenant as Tenant's contribution toward Landlord's Insurance for any calendar year shall be more than Tenant's Proportionate Share, then Landlord shall, within thirty (30) days after determining Tenant's Proportionate Share, refund (or credit against the next succeeding Rent payment) any excess amount paid by Tenant. An insurance premium bill, submitted by Landlord to Tenant, shall be sufficient evidence of the amount of premium to be paid.\n\nTenant will not do, or permit anything to be done, in or upon the Premises or bring or keep or permit anything to be brought into or kept on the Premises, which in any manner shall constitute an increased hazard or shall increase the premiums for insurance on the Shopping Center, or any part thereof. Tenant shall pay any such increased cost of insurance, including increases brought about by increased normal appreciation in the replacement cost of the building in which the Premises is located, including that which may result from any such act or omission of Tenant. In the event the Permitted Use results in the payment of any deductible by Landlord or causes any increase of premium for the property or casualty insurance rates on the Premises or the building in which it is located above the rate for the least hazardous type of occupancy legally permitted therein, Tenant shall pay Landlord upon demand such deductible or additional premiums on said property or casualty insurance policies incurred by reason thereof, provided that the insurance company states in writing that such payment or increase is attributable to the nature of Tenant's Permitted Use.\n\n## SECTION 9.03. Indemnification.\n\nSubject to Section 9.04, Tenant shall indemnify Landlord, its officers, directors, members, beneficiaries, partners, representatives, agents and employees, and save them harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, damages, liability, cost and expense, including reasonable attorneys' fees arising from or out of: (a) any occurrence in, upon or about the Premises; (b) failure to maintain the Premises in accordance with Section 10.01, (c) the occupancy or use by Tenant of the Premises, (d) default by Tenant of any Lease obligations beyond any applicable cure period, or (e) any negligent or tortious act or omission of Tenant, its agents, contractors, suppliers, employees, servants, customers or licensees and any person or entity conducting business in the Premises. For the purpose hereof, the Premises shall include the sidewalks and service areas adjoining the same and the loading platform area allocated to the use of Tenant. In case Landlord or any other party so indemnified shall, without fault, be made a party to any litigation commenced by or against Tenant, or if Landlord or any such party shall, in its sole discretion, determine that it must intervene in such litigation to protect its interest hereunder, including, without limitation, the incurring of costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees in connection with relief of Tenant ordered pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. § 101 et seq.), then Tenant shall protect and hold them harmless by attorneys satisfactory to Landlord and shall pay all costs, expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred or paid by such party in connection with such litigation. Landlord shall have the right to engage its own attorneys in connection with any provision of this Lease. The foregoing provisions of this Article IX shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of the Term.\n\nSubject to Section 9.04, Landlord shall indemnify Tenant, its officers, directors, members, beneficiaries, partners, representatives, agents and employees, and save them harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, damages, liability, cost and expense, including reasonable attorneys' fees arising from or out of: (i) any occurrence in, upon or about the Common Areas of the Shopping Center, to the extent Landlord controls such Common Areas; (ii) default by Landlord of any Lease obligation beyond any applicable cure period; or (iii) any grossly negligent or intentionally malicious act of Landlord, its agents, contractors, suppliers, employees, servants, or licensees.\n\n13\n\nG:\\Leases\\Andrea\\Winchester Square\\Orangetheory Fitness\\Lease v.5 11-17-17.docx\n\nCASTO\nLEGAL\nDEPT.\n\n## SECTION 9.04. Release and Waiver of Subrogation.\n\nLandlord and Tenant mutually release and discharge each other (as well as the officers, directors, partners, members, agents and employees of each other) from responsibility and liability (by way of subrogation or otherwise) for loss or damage to any building, structure or other property (real or personal) of the other party, or any resulting loss of income that is actually insured or required to be insured against under this Lease by the releasing party. This release and discharge shall be applicable even though such loss or damage may have been caused by the negligence of the party hereby released. Landlord and Tenant agree to include a waiver of subrogation endorsement in each of their respective casualty insurance policies reflecting the agreement set forth in this Section 9.04.\n\n## ARTICLE X - MAINTENANCE OF LEASED PREMISES\n\n## SECTION 10.01. Tenant's Maintenance Obligations.\n\nExcept as otherwise specifically stated herein, Tenant shall, in a good and workmanlike manner, maintain and make all necessary repairs and replacements to the Premises; the heating, ventilating and air conditioning units and systems (the \"HVAC\"), sprinkler, electrical, plumbing and sewer systems, grease guards and grease traps exclusively serving the Premises or located within the Premises; interior and exterior doors, door frames, door hardware, and door openers; windows and window frames; and plate glass. Tenant shall keep the Premises in a safe, dry and first-class condition, free from insects, vermin, bugs, pests, and parasites, using professional extermination services where necessary and in compliance with all Legal Requirements. Tenant shall enter into a service contract with a reputable company approved in writing by Landlord for regular servicing of the heating and air conditioning equipment (the \"HVAC Service Contract\") and any grease trap and grease containment system exclusively serving the Premises, on at least a quarterly basis. Tenant shall provide Landlord with a copy of all such service contracts and any maintenance records requested by Landlord. In addition, Tenant shall provide Landlord with evidence that such equipment (including grease trap and grease containment system, if applicable) was serviced upon the completion of such service. Grease traps exclusively serving the Premises shall be serviced only between the hours of midnight and 7:00 a.m. Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, all costs of repair or replacement of plate glass and any other damage occurring as a result of vandalism at the Premises shall be Tenant's responsibility and Landlord shall have no liability for such damage. Tenant further agrees and acknowledges that vandalism and similar third- party acts do not constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.\n\nAnything in this Article X to the contrary notwithstanding, but provided that Tenant is open and operating and not otherwise in default hereunder, and further provided Tenant has entered into the HVAC Service Contract as required above, Tenant shall not be required to pay in excess of One Thousand and 00/100 ($1,000.00) per calendar year toward non-routine costs of replacing, repairing or maintaining the HVAC serving the Premises (the \"HVAC Cap\"). For the avoidance of doubt, the following items shall not be included when determining the amounts spent by Tenant in any calendar year toward non-routine replacement, repair and maintenance of the HVAC serving the Premises for purposes of applying the HVAC Cap: (1) any such replacement, maintenance or repairs required due to the negligence, actions, or fault of Tenant, (2) the cost of the HVAC Service Contract, and (3) the cost of all routine or regularly scheduled maintenance and repairs. If Landlord elects in its sole discretion to replace the HVAC unit, thereafter this paragraph and the HVAC Cap described herein shall be deemed null, void and of no further force or effect. For clarification, following any such one-time replacement by Landlord, Tenant shall be obligated to make any future repairs and replacements to the HVAC system, at Tenant's sole cost and expense.\n\nTenant shall immediately contact Landlord should the need for any emergency repairs arise and Tenant shall otherwise promptly provide Landlord written notice of any maintenance or repair responsibility of Landlord. If Tenant fails to comply with the foregoing sentence, Landlord shall have no liability for the maintenance or repair work performed even if otherwise within its scope of responsibility.\n\n## SECTION 10.02. Landlord's Maintenance Obligations.\n\nLandlord shall be responsible, except as hereinafter stated, at its expense, to maintain and as necessary make repairs and replacements of or to structural walls (excluding plate glass, doors and doorframes), foundations, the roof; and common utility lines and sprinkler systems (not exclusively servicing the Premises) to the point of connection to the Premises or its utility meter. Landlord's obligation to maintain and as necessary make repairs and replacements of or to all or certain portions of the Premises and/or the building of which the Premises comprises a portion, pursuant to this Section 10.02, shall not be construed or interpreted to apply to Landlord's obligations to repair or replace the Premises in the event of a casualty, which event and obligations shall be governed solely by Article XV, below. The costs associated with such maintenance, repair or replacement obligations are included in the definition of Common Area Maintenance Costs as set forth in Section 8.05 hereof. To the extent that any repair or replacement is necessitated on account of the negligence, actions, or fault of Tenant, including, without limitation, on account of any alterations or modifications made by Tenant to the Premises (whether or not consented to or approved by Landlord) the cost thereof shall be paid by Tenant.\n\n## SECTION 10.03. Landlord's Non-liability.\n\nExcept for a breach of Landlord's obligations in Section 10.02 and subject to Section 10.01, Landlord shall have no liability whether direct, indirect, or consequential, to Tenant or any other person for any expense, damage or injury: (a) done or occasioned by or from (or by leakage or odors from) any electrical, gas, water, steam, heating, air conditioning, plumbing, sprinkler and sewer lines and systems located in, upon or about the Premises or the building in which the Premises is located; (b) occasioned by water, snow, ice, or dampness being upon or coming into the Premises through the roof, walls, floors, windows, doors, sewers, or otherwise, regardless of the source; (c) arising from acts of negligence or omissions of Tenant, its employees, or invitees; (d) arising from the acts or omissions, odor or noise, of adjoining tenants or of any owners or occupants of adjoining or contiguous property; (e) for any expense, damage or injury incurred by reason of forced entry by any person or by any attempt thereof; (f) arising from acts by the public or caused by operations or construction of any private, public or quasi-public work; or (g) for any latent defect in the Premises or in the building of which it forms a part or for any change or modification thereof.

Surrender.\n\nAt the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, Tenant shall surrender and return possession of the Premises, broom clean and in good order, condition and repair, ordinary wear and tear and damage by casualty excepted and in accordance with Section 3.03. Tenant shall remove all personal property and trade fixtures from the Premises and if Tenant fails to do so, all such items shall be deemed abandoned by Tenant and Landlord may remove the same without liability to Tenant and at Tenant's cost, or may deduct such amount from the Security Deposit. Tenant shall, upon request by Landlord, remove any items installed by Tenant, pursuant to instruction of Landlord delivered pursuant to Section 3.03 hereof. If Tenant fails to remove its storefront signage upon expiration of the Term in accordance with Section 3.04, Tenant shall pay Landlord the Signage Removal Fee. The provisions of this Article ✗I shall survive the termination of this Lease.\n\n## SECTION 11.02. Holding Over.\n\nAny holding over after the expiration of the Term with the prior written consent of Landlord shall be construed to be a tenancy from month to month at a Minimum Rent equal to one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the Minimum Rent effective for the final Lease Year or partial Lease Year preceding expiration of the Term, together with an amount reasonably estimated by Landlord for the monthly Additional Rent charges payable pursuant to this Lease, and shall otherwise be on the same terms and conditions as herein. Any holding over without Landlord's prior written consent shall constitute a tenancy at sufferance, terminable upon written notice by Landlord and shall entitle Landlord to exercise all remedies set forth in Section 17.02. Additionally, should Tenant hold over without Landlord's prior written consent, Tenant shall be liable for Minimum Rent and Additional Rent equal to two hundred percent (200%) of the amounts effective for the final Lease Year or partial Lease Year preceding the expiration of the Term.\n\n## ARTICLE XII - ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING\n\n## SECTION 12.01. Assignment and Subletting.\n\nExcept as expressly set forth herein, Tenant shall not assign this Lease, sublease or otherwise transfer all or any portion of the rights granted by this Lease (any of the foregoing herein an \"Assignment\") without the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent may be withheld in Landlord's sole discretion. In the event of an Assignment, Tenant shall remain primarily liable for Tenant's obligations hereunder and the assignee shall assume all obligations of Tenant in writing. If Tenant is a franchisee, Tenant shall provide Landlord with written evidence of Tenant's franchisor's consent to such Assignment.\n\nProvided Tenant is not then in default hereunder, Tenant may, without Landlord's consent, enter into an Assignment: (i) to any entity controlled by, in control of or under common control with Tenant; (ii) to any entity which shall acquire all or substantially all of the stock or all or substantially all of the assets of Tenant as a result of a consolidation, merger or sale, provided the tangible net worth of such entity is not less than the greater of Tenant's tangible net worth at the Effective Date or Tenant's tangible net worth immediately prior to such Assignment; (iii) to Tenant's Franchisor pursuant to the provisions of the Addendum to Lease Agreement, attached hereto and made a part hereof; or (iv) to an authorized, bona fide Orangetheory Fitness franchisee (an \"OTFF\") provided such OTFF meets all financial and business qualifications required by Tenant's Franchisor and by Landlord (each a \"Permitted Assignment\"). In the event of a Permitted Assignment, Tenant and any Guarantors shall be released on the effective date of such Permitted Assignment from their obligations under this Lease and any Guaranty occurring after the effective date of such Permitted Assignment. Tenant shall provide Landlord with advance written notice of any such Assignment together with reasonably detailed evidence that the tangible net worth of such successor entity meets the requirements set forth herein and any other relevant information that Landlord shall reasonably require. Within fifteen (15) days of the consummation of such Assignment, Tenant shall provide Landlord with a true and correct copy of the relevant assignment, sublease or transfer agreement together with reasonably detailed evidence that the tangible net worth of such successor entity meets the requirements set forth herein. The transfer of less than fifty percent (50%) of the membership units or stock in Tenant's entity shall not constitute an Assignment under the terms of this Lease. In the event Tenant shall request the consent of Landlord to any Assignment, then Tenant shall pay as Additional Rent: (i) One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500) (\"Assignment Fee\") to cover Landlord's expenses incurred in connection therewith; and (ii) one hundred percent (100%) of all amounts paid by the assignee in excess of the Rent. All Assignment documents shall be in a form prepared by or reasonably acceptable to Landlord. No consent or approval by Landlord to such Assignment shall be binding on Landlord until: (A) receipt by Landlord of the Assignment Fee; and (B) delivery of Landlord's written consent to Tenant.\n\n## ARTICLE XIII - GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS\n\n## SECTION 13.01. Governmental Regulations.\n\nTenant shall, at Tenant's sole cost and expense, comply with all Legal Requirements applicable to the Premises and/or Tenant's use and/or occupancy thereof. Tenant, at its sole cost and expense, shall install and keep the Premises equipped with all fire suppression and safety appliances, devices, equipment and applications required by any governmental authority or code or recommended by Landlord's insurer. Tenant shall allow Landlord to inspect all licenses and permits necessary for the operation of Tenant's business operation.\n\n15\n\nG:\\Leases\\Andrea\\Winchester Square\\Orangetheory Fitness\\Lease v.5 11-17-17.docx\n\nCASTO\nLEGAL\nDEPT.\n\n## SECTION 13.02. Hazardous Materials.\n\nTenant agrees that it will not place, hold, release or dispose of any pollutant, contaminant, waste, hazardous, toxic or radioactive substance or material, including but not limited to, medical waste and any hazardous substance, pollutant or contaminant (collectively, \"Hazardous Materials\") defined as such in (or for purposes of) the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"), any so-called \"Superfund\" or \"Superlien\" law, the Toxic Substance Control Act, or any other federal, state or local statute, law, ordinance, code, rule, regulation, interpretation or order relating to or imposing liability or standards of conduct concerning any Hazardous Materials, as now or at any time hereafter in effect (herein referred to collectively as \"Environmental Laws\") in, under, or about the Premises or Shopping Center. Tenant further agrees that it will not cause or allow any asbestos to be incorporated into any improvements or alterations made to the Premises. Tenant hereby indemnifies Landlord against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, injuries, costs, expenses, and claims of any and every kind and nature whatsoever (including without limitation court costs and attorneys' fees) which may be paid, incurred, or suffered by, or asserted against Landlord for, with respect to, or as a direct or indirect result of: (a) a breach by Tenant of the foregoing covenants; or (b) to the extent caused or allowed by Tenant or any agent, employee, or licensee of Tenant, the presence on or under, or the escape, seepage, leakage, spillage, discharge, emission, or release from, onto or into the Premises, the Shopping Center, the atmosphere, any watercourse, or the groundwater of any Hazardous Material (including without limitation any losses, liabilities, damages, injuries, costs, expenses, or claims asserted or arising under any Environmental Law). The provisions of this Section 13.02 shall survive the termination of this Lease for a period of twenty-four months. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Tenant's Permitted Use requires Tenant to bring onto the Premises substances which are included in the definition of \"Hazardous Material\", but which are permitted by law to be stored for use and used in connection with Tenant's Permitted Use, Tenant may bring such substances onto the Premises for said lawful use, but Tenant shall be solely responsible for the proper storage, use and off-site disposal of such substances (including medical waste) in accordance with Legal Requirements. Tenant shall promptly upon receipt of written request from Landlord, furnish a list of all types and quantities of Hazardous Materials or wastes including, but not limited to, petroleum products, which Tenant intends to treat, store, handle or dispose of at the Premises, both above or below ground. Tenant shall advise Landlord in writing of any changes in Tenant's use of such Hazardous Materials within five (5) days of the date of such change. Tenant shall immediately notify Landlord and Landlord's Property Manager both by telephone and in writing of any spill or unauthorized discharge of Hazardous Materials or of any condition constituting an “imminent hazard\" under Environmental Laws. Landlord, Landlord's representatives and employees may enter the Premises at any time during the Term to inspect Tenant's compliance herewith.\n\n## ARTICLE XIV - SUBORDINATION; ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATES\n\n## SECTION 14.01. Subordination.\n\nTenant agrees s that this Lease is and shall be subordinate to any mortgages, deeds of trust, superior leases and ground leases that are now, or may hereafter be placed upon the Premises and to any and all advances to be made thereunder and all renewals, replacements and extensions thereof. Tenant also acknowledges that any mortgagee or beneficiary may elect to have this Lease constitute a prior lien to its mortgage or deed of trust, and in the event Tenant receives notice of such election, this Lease shall be deemed prior in lien to such mortgage or deed of trust. Tenant shall, upon demand and without cost to Landlord, execute an instrument to effectuate or confirm the subordination of this Lease to any such mortgage within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such request.\n\nIn the event of foreclosure, or conveyance by deed in lieu of foreclosure, or exercise of the power of sale under any mortgage and/or deed of trust, or in the event Landlord sells, conveys or otherwise transfers its interest in the Shopping Center or any portion thereof containing the Premises, provided Tenant is not in default, this Lease shall remain in full force and effect and Tenant shall attorn to the new owner. Tenant agrees to execute an instrument reasonably satisfactory to the new owner whereby Tenant recognizes such successor as Landlord under this Lease within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such request; provided, however, that such successor shall not be bound by any payment of Rent for more than one (1) month in advance, except for any Security Deposit transferred to such successor.\n\n## SECTION 14.02. Modification of Lease in Connection With Financing.\n\nIf Landlord's lender requires modification of this Lease as a condition to making a loan, Tenant shall consent to such modification by executing the same and returning it to Landlord within ten (10) days of its submission to Tenant, provided such modification is reasonable, does not modify the size or location of the Premises, increase the Rent or abridge the Term of this Lease.\n\n## SECTION 14.03. Estoppel Certificates.\n\nTenant shall, without charge, at any time, and from time to time, within fifteen (15) days following notice from Landlord, or any mortgagee or purchaser, execute, acknowledge and deliver to the requesting party or such other person designated by Landlord, a duly executed and acknowledged certificate (hereafter, an “estoppel certificate\") certifying that this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect (or if there have been modifications, that the Lease is in full force and effect as modified and stating the modifications), and the dates to which the Minimum Rent, Additional Rent and any other charges have been paid, and attesting as to the status of any other matters reasonably pertinent to the status of this Lease and the performance of the parties thereunder.\n\n## ARTICLE XV - DESTRUCTION OF LEASED PREMISES\n\n## SECTION 15.01. Reconstruction of Damaged Premises.\n\nTenant shall immediately notify Landlord in the case of fire or other casualty. If the Premises is damaged, but is not thereby rendered untenantable, Landlord shall cause such damage to be repaired, but no Rent shall be abated. In the event the Premises shall be partially or totally destroyed by fire or other casualty insured under the insurance carried by Landlord so as to become partially or totally untenantable, then Landlord shall restore the Premises to a\n\nCASTO\n\n16\n\nG:\\Leases\\Andrea\\Winchester Square\\Orangetheory Fitness\\Lease v.5 11-17-17.docx\n\nLEGAL\n\nDEPT.\n\ntenantable condition within one hundred eighty (180) days following Landlord's receipt of insurance proceeds (unless Landlord shall elect not to rebuild as hereinafter provided). During such restoration period, the Rent shall be abated in proportion to the GLA of the Premises rendered untenantable and Tenant shall have no right to terminate this Lease. Payment of full Rent shall resume on the date Tenant reopens for business to the public. Tenant shall be obligated to reopen for business within thirty (30) days following the date Landlord advises Tenant that the Premises is tenantable. In no event shall Landlord be required to repair or replace Tenant's merchandise, trade fixtures, furnishings or equipment, plate glass, signs, personal property or any tenant improvements constructed by Tenant as part of Tenant's Work (defined in Exhibit B). If Landlord repairs or rebuilds the Premises as herein provided, Tenant, at Tenant's sole cost, shall repair or replace Tenant's merchandise, trade fixtures, furnishings, floor coverings, equipment, plate glass, signs, personal property and Tenant's Work in a manner and to at least a condition equal to that prior to the damage or destruction thereof.\n\n## SECTION 15.02. Landlord's Right to Terminate.\n\nIf (a) more than thirty percent (30%) of the GLA of the building in which the Premises is located or (b) more than thirty percent (30%) of the GLA of the Shopping Center shall be damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty, or (c) all or any part of the Shopping Center or said building or the Premises is damaged or destroyed at any time by the occurrence of any risk not insured under the insurance carried by Landlord, or if the net insurance award to Landlord, in Landlord's reasonable opinion, is not sufficient to rebuild the Premises or the Shopping Center, then Landlord may terminate this Lease by giving notice to Tenant of Landlord's election so to terminate within ninety (90) days after the occurrence of such damage or destruction. If this Lease is so terminated, Tenant shall remove all of its property from the Premises within fifteen (15) days after the notice of termination is given.\n\n## SECTION 15.03. Tenant's Right to Terminate.\n\nIf Landlord notifies Tenant that the Premises cannot be restored within one hundred eighty (180) days following Landlord's receipt of insurance proceeds, then Tenant may terminate this Lease by giving notice to Landlord of Tenant's election to terminate within thirty (30) days after receipt of Landlord's notice. Additionally, if Landlord fails to substantially restore the Premises within such one hundred eighty (180) day period, then Tenant may terminate this Lease by giving, within thirty (30) days after the end of such one hundred eighty (180) day period, but before the Premises are actually restored, notice to Landlord of Tenant's election to terminate.\n\n## ARTICLE XVI - EMINENT DOMAIN\n\n## SECTION 16.01. Eminent Domain.\n\nIf any part of the Premises shall be taken by governmental authority pursuant to its power of eminent domain (or Landlord conveys any part of the Premises pursuant to a threat thereof), then the Premises shall be reduced in proportion to the amount so taken or conveyed, unless the amount taken shall be so great that it would be impractical for Tenant to continue its business operations, in which event this Lease shall be terminated as of the date of such taking. All compensation awarded for any taking of the Premises or the Shopping Center shall belong solely to and be the property of Landlord, and Tenant assigns to Landlord all of Tenant's rights with respect hereto. However, Tenant may apply for reimbursement from the condemning authority (if permitted by law) for moving expenses, removal of Tenant's trade fixtures or loss of Tenant's business good will, provided that any such reimbursement shall not reduce the amount of the award otherwise recoverable from the condemning authority by Landlord. If a portion of the Premises is taken and this Lease is not terminated, Landlord shall at its own expense restore the remaining portion of the Premises to a complete architectural unit, but such work shall not exceed the original scope of work required to be done by Landlord pursuant to this Lease as set forth in Exhibit B. Furthermore, in the event of such taking, the Rent shall be reduced proportionately based on the percentage of the Premises taken and not restored by Landlord. No other taking, appropriation or condemnation shall cause this Lease to be terminated, nor shall such proceedings operate as or be deemed an eviction of Tenant or a breach of Landlord's covenant of quiet enjoyment.\n\n## ARTICLE XVII - DEFAULT BY TENANT\n\n## SECTION 17.01. Events of Default.\n\nEach of the following shall constitute an \"Event of Default\":\n\n\t\t(a) Any failure of Tenant to pay any Rent or other charges when due hereunder;\n\n\t(b) if Tenant conducts business other than for the Permitted Use or under a trade name other than the Trade Name as set forth herein;\n\n(c) if Tenant shall become insolvent or shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or if Tenant permits this Lease to be taken under any writ of execution;\n\n\t\t(d) if Tenant shall falsify any report required to be furnished to Landlord under this Lease;\n\n(e) if Tenant shall abandon or vacate the Premises or fail to keep the Premises continuously and uninterruptedly open for business each business day during the hours set forth herein (except, as may otherwise specifically be permitted herein);\n\n(f) if Tenant shall fail or refuse to keep and to perform any of the other covenants, conditions, stipulations or agreements herein contained including, but not limited to, the rules and regulations attached hereto as Exhibit E for more than thirty (30) days after notice of such default shall have been mailed (or such additional reasonable time as Tenant may require if cure is not practicable with such thirty (30) day period and Tenant has commenced the cure and is diligently continuing to completion, but not to exceed sixty (60) days). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Tenant fails to perform or defaults in the performance of any term, covenant or condition of this\n\nCASTO\n\n17\n\nG:\\Leases\\Andrea\\Winchester Square\\Orangetheory Fitness\\Lease v.5 11-17-17.docx\n\nLEGAL\n\nDEPT.\n\nLease on two (2) or more separate occasions during any twelve (12) month period, then, even if such failures or defaults have been cured by Tenant, any further failure or default by Tenant during the twelve (12) month period shall be deemed an Event of Default hereunder without the ability of cure by Tenant and Landlord shall not be obligated to send Tenant any notice of default; or\n\n(g) if Tenant shall be in default under its franchise agreement beyond any applicable cure period and/or if Tenant's franchise agreement is terminated.\n\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if Tenant defaults under this Lease, Landlord shall contemporaneously deliver to Franchisor a copy of any default notice sent by Landlord to Tenant. Franchisor shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cure the default and notify Landlord whether or not it intends to cure the default and take an assignment of Tenant's interest pursuant to the Addendum attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference. Franchisor shall have an additional fifteen (15) days from the expiration of any cure period afforded Tenant under this Lease in which to cure the Tenant's default. All notices to Franchisor shall be sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, or by overnight courier service, to the address set forth in Section 1.01(A).\n\n## SECTION 17.02. Remedies.\n\nUpon the occurrence of any \"Event of Default,\" Landlord in addition to any other rights or remedies it may have under this Lease, in law or in equity, may without any notice or demand:\n\n(a) Lease Termination. Elect to terminate this Lease and the tenancy created hereby by giving notice to Tenant, which termination shall be effective as of the date of such notice or any later date therein specified by Landlord in such notice (and on the effective date of such termination, all obligations and liabilities of Landlord hereunder shall terminate), and, without further notice, Landlord shall have the right to repossess the Premises, by summary proceedings or otherwise, and remove Tenant and all other persons and property from the Premises, without liability for damage to, and without obligation to store, such property. After such termination, Landlord may change the locks. Landlord shall be entitled to recover all loss and damage Landlord may suffer by reason of such termination, whether through inability to relet the Premises on satisfactory terms or otherwise, including without limitation, the following (without duplication by any element of damages): (i) accrued Rent to the effective date of termination together with late charges and interest thereon at the rate of the Default Rate (defined in Section 1.01 (S)) from the date owed through the date paid; plus (ii) the cost of recovering the Premises, including without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees; plus (iii) all costs of enforcing this Lease, including, without limitation, the provisions of this Section 17.02 against Tenant; plus (iv) costs and expenses incurred by Landlord for any repairs, maintenance, changes, alterations and improvements to the Premises to prevent damage to the Premises or to prepare the Premises for reletting to a subsequent tenant, advertising costs, brokerage commissions, and reasonable attorneys' fees (collectively, \"Reletting Costs\"); plus (v) the present value of the Rent (discounted at a rate of interest equal to eight percent (8%) per annum (\"Discount Rate\")) that would have accrued under this Lease for the Term, reduced by the present value of the actual Rent, discounted at the Discount Rate, received from Landlord's successful reletting of the Premises. If at the time of any reletting of the Premises there exists other space in the Shopping Center available for leasing, Landlord shall have no obligation to relet the Premises, even though the Premises may be relet prior to the date such other space is leased. Landlord shall in no event be liable in any way whatsoever for its failure to relet the Premises or any part thereof, or in the event that the Premises are relet, for its failure to collect the rent under such reletting, and no such failure to relet or failure to collect rent shall release or affect Tenant's liability for damages or otherwise under this Lease. For purposes of computing the amount of Rent that would have accrued after the effective date of termination, obligations for Real Estate Taxes and Landlord's Insurance costs shall be projected, based upon the rate of increase, if any, in such items from the Commencement Date through the termination date; plus (vi) any other costs or amounts necessary to compensate Landlord for all damages caused by Tenant's failure to perform its obligations hereunder; or\n\n(b) Repossession Without Termination. Elect to immediately, or at any time (whereupon all obligations and liability of Landlord hereunder shall terminate) thereafter, and without terminating this Lease, enter into and upon the Premises or any part thereof and take absolute possession of the same, expel or remove Tenant and any other person or entity who may be occupying the Premises, remove any and all of their property from the Premises, and change the locks. Tenant covenants and agrees that notwithstanding any such re-entry by Landlord, it shall pay and be liable for (on the days originally fixed herein for the payment thereof) amounts equal to the several installments of Rent and other charges reserved as they would, under the terms of this Lease, become due if Landlord had not re- entered as aforesaid, together with all Reletting Costs, and whether the Premises be relet or remain vacant in whole or in part or for a period less than the remainder of the Term, or for the whole thereof.\n\n- Landlord's Right to Relet Premises. Landlord may relet the Premises or any part thereof, for such Term and on such terms and conditions as Landlord, in its sole discretion, may determine. Rent received by Landlord from such reletting shall be applied first to Reletting Costs, second, to the payment of any indebtedness other than Rent due hereunder from Tenant to Landlord (in such order as Landlord shall determine), third, to the payment of Rent due and unpaid hereunder (in such order as Landlord shall determine), and the residue, if any, shall be held by Landlord and applied to the payment of other obligations of Tenant to Landlord as the same become due; and Tenant shall satisfy and pay to Landlord any deficiency upon demand therefor from time to time. No such re-entry or taking of possession of the Premises by Landlord shall be construed as an election on Landlord's part to terminate this Lease unless a written notice of such termination is given to Tenant. If Landlord relets the Premises, either before or after the termination of this Lease, all such rentals received from such Lease shall be and remain the exclusive property of Landlord, and Tenant shall not, at any time, be entitled to recover any such rental, provided, however, that Tenant shall be given credit for all rents received. Landlord may at any time, upon an occurrence of an Event of Default whether before or after a reletting, elect to terminate this Lease pursuant to Section 17.02(a) above.\n\n(d) New Locks; Disposition of Property. If Landlord terminates the Lease or terminates Tenant's possession: (i) Landlord shall have no obligation whatsoever to tender to Tenant a key for new locks installed at the\n\n18\n\nG:\\Leases\\Andrea\\Winchester Square\\Orangetheory Fitness\\Lease v.5 11-17-17.docx\n\nCASTO\nLRGAL\nDEFT.\n\nPremises; and (ii) any and all property which Landlord has the right to remove from the Premises pursuant to Section 17.02, shall at Tenant's sole cost and expense, be (a) stored and/or (b) sold at private or public sale for such price as Landlord may obtain, with the proceeds of any such sale being applied to amounts due from Tenant to Landlord under this Lease (including Landlord's attorneys' fees and other actual costs incurred by Landlord in the removal, storage and/or sale of such items), with any remainder to be paid to Tenant.\n\n(e) Late Charges and Interest. Any Rent not paid when due shall bear interest at the Default Rate until payment is received by Landlord. In addition, Tenant shall pay Landlord a late charge equal to fifteen percent (15%) of any amount ten (10) days or more overdue to compensate Landlord for the extra costs Landlord will incur as a result of such late payment. The parties agree that: (i) it would be impractical and extremely difficult to fix the actual damage that Landlord will suffer on account of Tenant's late payment; (ii) such interest and late charges represent a fair and reasonable estimate of the detriment that Landlord will suffer by reason of late payment by Tenant; and (iii) the payment of interest and late charges are distinct and separate in that the payment of interest is to compensate Landlord for the use of Landlord's money by Tenant, while the payment of late charge is to compensate Landlord for Landlord's processing, administrative and other costs incurred by Landlord as a result of Tenant's delinquent payments. Acceptance of such late charges and interest payments shall not be deemed consent by Landlord to late payments, nor a waiver of Landlord's right to insist upon timely payments at any time, nor a waiver of any remedies to which Landlord is entitled as a result of the late payment of Rent.\n\n(f) Landlord's Cure of Tenant Defaults. Except as expressly set forth herein to the contrary, if Tenant fails to perform any non-monetary obligation under this Lease for thirty (30) days after notice thereof by Landlord (except that no notice shall be required in emergencies), Landlord shall have the right (but not the duty), to perform such obligation on behalf and for the account of Tenant. In such event, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord upon demand, as Additional Rent, for all expenses incurred by Landlord in performing such obligation together with an amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) thereof for Landlord's overhead, and interest thereon at the Default Rate from the date such expenses were incurred. Landlord's performance of Tenant's obligations hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver or release of Tenant therefrom, or a waiver of any remedies to which Landlord is entitled to as a result of Tenant's failure to perform.\n\n(g) Cumulative Remedies. Pursuit of any of the foregoing remedies shall not preclude pursuit of any other remedies provided in this Lease or any other remedies provided by law, nor shall pursuit of any remedy herein provided constitute a forfeiture or waiver of any Rent due to Landlord hereunder or of any damage accruing to Landlord by reason of the violation of any of the terms, provisions and covenants herein contained. Forbearance by Landlord to enforce one or more of the remedies herein provided upon the occurrence of an Event of Default shall not be deemed or construed to constitute a waiver of such Event of Default.\n\n(h) Other Matters. No re-entry or repossession, repairs, changes, alterations, additions, reletting, acceptance of keys from Tenant, or any other action or omission by Landlord shall be construed as an election by Landlord to terminate this Lease or Tenant's right to possession, or to accept a surrender of the Premises, nor shall the same operate to release the Tenant in whole or in part from any of Tenant's obligations hereunder, unless express written notice of such intention is sent by Landlord to Tenant. Landlord may bring suits for amounts owed by Tenant hereunder or any portions thereof, as the same accrue or after the same have accrued, and no suit or recovery of any portion due hereunder shall be deemed a waiver of Landlord's right to collect all amounts to which Landlord is entitled hereunder, nor shall the same serve as any defense to any subsequent suit brought for any amount not theretofore reduced to judgment. Tenant agrees that Landlord shall not have a duty to mitigate any damages it may suffer as a result of a default by Tenant under this Lease, and any such duty implied or set forth in law is hereby expressly waived. Landlord shall be under no obligation to observe or perform any provision of this Lease on its part to be observed or performed which accrues after the date of any Event of Default by Tenant. The times set forth herein for the curing of violations by Tenant are of the essence of this Lease.\n\n## ARTICLE XVIII - BANKRUPTCY OR INSOLVENCY\n\n## SECTION 18.01. Conditions to the Assumption and Assignment of this Lease.\n\nTenant acknowledges that this Lease is a lease of nonresidential real property within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. § 365(d)(4) and a lease of real property in a shopping center within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. § 365(b)(3) and is governed by the provisions thereof. Tenant knowingly and voluntarily waives any right to seek time additional to the one hundred twenty (120) day period set forth in 11 U.S.C. § 365(d)(4) to assume or reject the Lease and acknowledges that there is no cause to seek such extension. Landlord's acceptance of Rent after the 120 day period specified in 11 U.S.C. § 365(d)(4) shall not constitute a waiver or estoppel with respect to the provisions of 11 U.S.C. § 365(d)(4). If Tenant, as Debtor-in-Possession, or the Trustee abandons the Premises, the same shall be deemed a rejection of the Lease. Landlord shall be entitled to at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice from Tenant, as Debtor-in-Possession, or its Trustee of any intention to abandon the Premises.\n\nNo election by the Trustee or Debtor-In-Possession to assume this Lease, whether under Chapter 7, 11 or 13, shall be effective unless, in addition to the provisions of 11 U.S.C. § 365(b)(3), each of the following conditions, which Landlord and Tenant acknowledge are commercially reasonable in the context of a bankruptcy proceeding of Tenant, have been satisfied, and Landlord has so acknowledged in writing: (a) the Trustee or the Debtor-In-Possession has cured, or has provided Landlord adequate assurance of a cure of all defaults under this Lease; (b) the Trustee or the Debtor-In-Possession has compensated, or has provided to Landlord adequate assurance that within ten (10) days from the date of assumption Landlord will be compensated for any pecuniary loss (including without limitation reasonable attorney fees and costs, whether incurred before or during a bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise) incurred by Landlord arising from the default of Tenant, the Trustee, or the Debtor-In-Possession as recited in Landlord's written statement of pecuniary loss sent to the Trustee or Debtor-In-Possession; (c) the Trustee or the Debtor-In- Possession has provided Landlord with adequate assurance of the future performance of each of Tenant's, the Trustee's\n\nG:\\Leases\\Andrea\\Winchester Square\\Orangetheory Fitness\\Lease v.5 11-17-17.docx\n\n19\n\nCASTO\nLEGAL\nDEPT.\n\nor Debtor-In-Possession's obligations under this Lease; and (d) Tenant as Debtor-In-Possession or its Trustee shall provide Landlord at least forty-five (45) days' prior written notice of any proceeding concerning the assumption of this Lease.\n\n## SECTION 18.02. Conditions to the Assignment.\n\nIf the Trustee or Debtor-In-Possession has assumed this Lease pursuant to the terms and provisions of Section 18.01 hereof, for the purpose of assigning (or elects to assign) Tenant's interest under this Lease or the estate created thereby, to any other person or entity, such interest or estate may be so assigned only if Landlord shall acknowledge in writing that the intended assignee has provided adequate assurance as defined in 11 U.S.C. §§ 365(b)(3) and 365(b)(1) and in this Section of future performance of all of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease to be performed by Tenant.\n\n## SECTION 18.03. Use and Occupancy Charges.\n\nWhen, pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code, the Trustee or Debtor-In-Possession shall be obligated to pay reasonable use and occupancy charges for the use of the Premises or any portion thereof, such charges shall not be less than the Rent obligations of Tenant.\n\n## ARTICLE XIX - ACCESS BY OWNER\n\n## SECTION 19.01. Landlord's Rights of Access.\n\nLandlord or its agents may have free access to the Premises at all reasonable times upon prior notice to Tenant, except in emergency situations when no such notice shall be required: (a) for the purpose of examining the Premises or to show the same to prospective purchasers and mortgagees at any time during the Term; (b) to prospective tenants during the last one hundred eighty (180) days of the Term; (c) to make any repairs which Landlord is required to perform under this Lease; and (d) if Tenant is in default for the purpose of exhibiting the Premises and putting up a \"For Lease\" or similar sign, which sign shall not be removed, obliterated, or hidden by Tenant provided that any such action by Landlord shall cause as little inconvenience as reasonably practicable. During or after any time Tenant abandons, vacates or ceases to actively operate its business in the Premises or is otherwise in default hereunder, Landlord may enter the Premises, without such entry being deemed a taking of possession, in order to decorate, remodel, repair, alter or otherwise prepare the Premises for occupancy, to secure the Premises against vandalism or burglary, and to take reasonable measures to preserve the good image of the Shopping Center. Landlord shall have the right at any time to install or place upon, or affix to the roof and exterior walls of the Premises equipment, signs, displays, antennas, and any other objects or structures of any kind provided the same shall not materially affect the structural integrity of the building. The exercise of any right of access reserved in this Article or elsewhere in this Lease by Landlord or its agents shall not be deemed an eviction or disturbance of Tenant, and Tenant shall not be allowed any abatement of Rent or damages for any injury or inconvenience or loss of or interruption of business occasioned thereby to Tenant or to any other person.\n\n## ARTICLE XX - QUIET ENJOYMENT\n\n## SECTION 20.01. Quiet Enjoyment\n\nProvided that Tenant has performed all of its obligations under this Lease, Landlord covenants that Tenant shall have and enjoy quiet and peaceable possession of the Premises during the Term free of molestation by Landlord, subject to the provisions of this Lease, and of all Legal Requirements, mortgages, ground leases, encumbrances and other matters of record affecting title to the Shopping Center.\n\n## ARTICLE XXI - MISCELLANEOUS\n\n## SECTION 21.01. No Accord and Satisfaction.\n\nPayment by Tenant or receipt by Landlord of a lesser amount than the Rent herein stipulated may be, at Landlord's sole option, deemed to be on account of the earliest due stipulated Rent, or deemed to be on account of Rent owing for the current period only, notwithstanding any instructions by or on behalf of Tenant to the contrary, which instructions shall be null and void. No endorsement or statement on any check or any letter accompanying any check or payment as Rent by Tenant shall be deemed an accord and satisfaction. Landlord may accept such check or payment without prejudice to Landlord's right to recover the balance of Rent or to pursue any other remedy in this Lease or in law or in equity against Tenant.\n\n## SECTION 21.02. Titles; Entire Agreement; Modifications.\n\nThe captions in this Lease are for reference and convenience only and are not part of this Lease. This Lease contains the entire agreement between Landlord and Tenant. All prior communications and negotiations, whether written or oral, are superseded by this Agreement. Any agreement hereafter made shall be ineffective to change, modify, or discharge this Lease unless such agreement is in writing and signed by both parties, and duly delivered between them.\n\n## SECTION 21.03. No Representations; \"As-Is” Basis.\n\nThe Premises is being taken by Tenant on an \"as-is\" basis, except as may be specifically provided otherwise in this Lease. By taking possession of the Premises, Tenant agrees: (a) that Landlord has satisfactorily completed all improvements, if any, to the Premises on Landlord's part to be performed, and (b) that as it relates to the condition of the Premises, and the fitness thereof generally and for Tenant's specific use, Tenant is relying on its own inspections, investigations and observations, and not on any representations alleged to have been made whether express or implied by Landlord or its agents. Upon Tenant's taking possession of the Premises any unexpired or unwaived contingency or cancellation provisions running to Tenant's benefit in this Lease shall thereby become void notwithstanding any time periods to the contrary in any such provision.\n\nCASTO\n\n20\n\nG:\\Leases\\Andrea\\Winchester Square\\Orangetheory Fitness\\Lease v.5 11-17-17.docx\n\nLEGAL\n\nDEPT.\n\n## SECTION 21.04. Delays.\n\nIf either party hereto shall be delayed in the performance of obligations hereunder by reason of strikes, lockouts, labor troubles, unusually severe weather, or inability to procure materials, or shall at any time be so delayed by reason of failure of power, restrictive governmental laws or reasons of a similar nature not the fault of the party delayed in performing work or doing acts required under the terms of this Lease, then performance of such act shall be excused for the period of the delay, and the period for the performance of any such act shall be extended for a period equivalent to the period of such delay. The provisions of this Section shall not operate to excuse Tenant from payment of Rent or any other payments required by this Lease. Landlord's reduction of heat, light, air conditioning, or any other services whatsoever to the Shopping Center because of any similar or dissimilar event constituting a cause for excusable delay hereunder shall not relieve Tenant from its obligations under this Lease.\n\n## SECTION 21.05. Governing Law; Venue; Service of Process.\n\nThis Lease shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state in which the Shopping Center is situated. If any provision of this Lease or the application thereof to any person, entity or circumstance shall, to any extent, be invalid or unenforceable, then, only to the extent permitted by law and by reason in light of such invalidity or unenforceability, the remainder of this Lease shall not be affected thereby and each remaining provision of the Lease shall be valid and enforceable. Tenant acknowledges and understands that this Lease and Tenant's ongoing dealings with Landlord constitute sufficient contacts with the State of Ohio to create personal jurisdiction. Landlord and Tenant hereby stipulate and agree that in any litigation arising out of this Lease, venue and jurisdiction over the subject matter and Landlord and Tenant shall be proper in the courts of the jurisdiction in which the Premises is located and in the Franklin County, Ohio Court of Common Pleas. Service of process upon Tenant in any such action may be effected by certified mail or personal service upon Tenant at the address contained in Section 1.01(A) or at the Premises.\n\n## SECTION 21.06. Brokers.\n\nLandlord and Tenant each warrant and represent to each other that there are no claims for brokerage commissions or finders fees in connection with consummating this Lease, except with respect to the brokers(s) specifically identified in Section 1.01(W) (the \"Brokers\") whose commission(s) shall be paid pursuant to a separate agreement. Each party agrees to indemnify and, except for the Brokers, hold the other harmless against any claims for commission or fees arising by reason of a breach by the indemnifying party of this representation and warranty.\n\n## SECTION 21.07. Notices.\n\nExcept for notice address changes, no notice or other communication given under this Lease shall be effective unless the same is in writing and is delivered in person; mailed by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, first class, postage prepaid; same-day couriered; or delivered via nationally recognized overnight courier, addressed: (a) if to Landlord, at the address set forth in Section 1.01(A), or to such other address as Landlord shall designate by giving notice thereof to Tenant, or (b) if to Tenant, at the address set forth in Section 1.01(A), or to the Premises, or to such other address as Tenant shall designate by giving notice thereof to Landlord. Any such notice, statement, certificate, request or demand shall, in the case of registered or certified mailing, be deemed to have been given on the third day after the date mailed as aforesaid in any post office or branch post office regularly maintained by the United States Government, and in the case of delivery by nationally recognized overnight courier service, shall be deemed to have been given upon the date of delivery to an authorized agent of such courier service, except in each case for notice of change of address or revocation of a prior notice, which shall only be effective upon receipt. Neither party shall refuse to accept delivery of notice. Proof of the posting of any notice and of the date of any acceptance or refusal of delivery or of the final attempt at the delivery thereof shall be deemed sufficient proof that such notice was given and delivered or refused as the case may be. Either party may change its address for purposes of notice by written notice given to the other party by one of the methods herein provided or via regular U.S. Mail.\n\n## SECTION 21.08. Waiver; Election of Remedies.\n\nOne or more waivers of any covenant or condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach. The consent or approval by Landlord to or of any act by Tenant requiring Landlord's consent or approval shall not be deemed to render unnecessary Landlord's consent or approval to or of any subsequent similar act by Tenant. Whenever Tenant shall claim under any provision of this Lease requiring Landlord not to unreasonably withhold its consent or approval that Landlord has so unreasonably withheld its consent or approval, Tenant shall have no claim for damages by reason of such alleged withholding, and Tenant's sole remedy therefor shall be declaratory or injunctive relief, but in any event without the recovery of damages. The failure to insist upon a strict performance of any term, condition or covenant contained in this Lease shall not be deemed a waiver of any rights or remedies that a party may have and shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach or default in the terms, conditions or covenants herein contained. Any such failure shall not be construed as creating a custom of accepting other than strict performance or as modifying in any way the terms, covenants or conditions of this Lease. No breach of a covenant or condition of this Lease shall be deemed to have been waived unless such waiver is in writing. No act or thing done shall be deemed an acceptance of surrender of the Premises, and no agreement to accept such surrender shall be valid, unless in writing signed by Landlord. Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, the rights and remedies under this Lease or under any specific Section, subsection or clause hereof shall be cumulative and in addition to any and all other rights and remedies a party has or may have elsewhere under this Lease or at law or equity. Nothing contained in this Lease shall be construed to confer upon any entity other than Landlord or Tenant any rights, benefits or causes of action, except to the extent specifically otherwise provided in this Lease and except to the extent provided for the benefit of any mortgagee, deed-of-trust beneficiary, ground lessor or trustee of Landlord.\n\n## SECTION 21.09. Legal Expenses.\n\nIn the event suit shall be brought by Landlord for recovery of possession of the Premises, for the recovery of Rent or any other amount due under the provisions of this Lease, or because of the breach of any other covenant herein contained on the part of Tenant or Landlord to be performed, and a breach shall be established by a court of competent\n\n21\n\nG:\\Leases\\Andrea\\Winchester Square\\Orangetheory Fitness\\Lease v.5 11-17-17.docx\n\nCASTO\nLROAL\nDEPT.\n\njurisdiction, the non-prevailing party shall pay to the prevailing party all filing fees and court costs along with reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses incurred by the prevailing party in connection therewith.\n\n## SECTION 21.10. Waiver of Jury Trial and Counterclaims.\n\nAcknowledging the commercial nature of this transaction, Landlord and Tenant hereby mutually waive any and all rights which either party may have to request a jury trial in any action, proceeding or counterclaim brought by either of the parties hereto against the other on any matter whatsoever arising out of or in any way connected with this Lease, the relationship of Landlord and Tenant, Tenant's use or occupancy of the Premises, and/or any claim of injury or damage. If Landlord commences any proceedings, Tenant waives its right to and will not interpose any non- compulsory counterclaim in such proceedings.\n\n## SECTION 21.11. Successors; Joint and Several Liability.\n\nAll rights and liabilities herein given to, or imposed upon, the respective parties hereto shall extend to and bind the several respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and permitted assigns of the said parties. If there is more than one individual or entity defined as \"Tenant\" in this Lease, the term \"Tenant\" as used herein shall include all named individuals and entities, they shall all be bound jointly and severally by the terms, covenants and agreements herein. No rights, however, shall inure to the benefit of any assignee of Tenant unless the assignment to such assignee has been approved by Landlord in writing or is otherwise permitted under this Lease.\n\n## SECTION 21.12. Organizational Information; Asset and Financial Disclosure.\n\nUpon request, Tenant agrees to provide Landlord with evidence of Tenant's organization and proper authority to enter into this Lease, including, but not limited to (as applicable), articles of incorporation, bylaws, corporate resolutions, certificate of good standing, partnership articles, partnership certificate, partnership resolution, and any other documentation reasonably requested by Landlord. Tenant hereby authorizes and consents to Landlord's performing a credit check with and seeking other information as to Tenant and any Guarantor hereof from any credit reference, prior lessor, credit bureau or credit reporting agency, as may be needed from time to time to monitor Tenant's and any such Guarantor's credit, to assist in collecting any monies past due, to facilitate a financing, refinancing or sale of the Shopping Center, or to establish, verify or confirm Tenant's or any such Guarantor's then current address.\n\nTenant hereby covenants that it has not and shall not transfer, convey, or assign any assets to an Ohio Legacy Trust as defined in Ohio Revised Code § 5816 as may be amended from time to time, or to any form of Domestic Asset Protection Trust.\n\nTenant shall promptly disclose to Landlord any material adverse change in the financial condition of Tenant or of the Guarantor occurring after the date hereof. Upon Landlord's written request, which request shall not be made more than once in any twelve (12) month period (unless such request is related to a bona fide potential sale, financing, or re-financing of the Shopping Center or in connection with any proposed Assignment of this Lease by Tenant, in which case such limit on requests shall not apply), Tenant shall promptly furnish to Landlord, from time to time, financial statements reflecting Tenant's current financial condition, which financial statements shall be certified as being true and correct by the chief financial officer and by the chief executive officer of Tenant, and/or by a certified public accountant, and shall upon Landlord's written request, which request shall not be made more than once in any twelve (12) month period (unless such request is related to a bona fide potential sale, financing, or re-financing of the Shopping Center or in connection with any proposed Assignment of this Lease by Tenant, in which case such limit on requests shall not apply), promptly furnish Landlord financial statements reflecting the current financial condition of each Guarantor of this Lease, which financial statements shall be certified as being true and correct by the chief financial officer and by the chief executive officer and/or by a certified public accountant of each such Guarantor.\n\n## SECTION 21.13. Recording.\n\nThis Lease shall not be recorded. A Memorandum of Lease describing the Premises, Term and restating such other non-economic provisions of this Lease as the parties may mutually agree on, may be recorded by either party at the sole cost of the party seeking recordation.\n\n## SECTION 21.14. Submission of Lease.\n\nThe submission of this Lease to Tenant unsigned, shall be for examination purposes only, and shall not constitute a reservation of or option for Tenant to lease, or otherwise create any interest of Tenant in the Premises. Execution of this Lease by Tenant shall be irrevocable for a period of thirty (30) days. The return to Landlord of Tenant-executed copies of this Lease shall not be binding upon Landlord, notwithstanding any preparation or anticipatory reliance or expenditures by Tenant or any time interval, until Landlord has in fact executed and actually delivered a fully executed original counterpart of this Lease to Tenant. This Lease shall become effective only when duly executed by both Landlord and Tenant, and the mutual delivery and receipt of at least one duly executed original for each party.\n\n## SECTION 21.15. Relationship of the Parties.\n\nThe only relationship created by this Lease is that of Landlord and Tenant. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed or construed as creating the relationship of principal and agent or of partnership or of joint venture between the parties hereto. In the event any language is deleted from this Lease, said language shall be deemed to have never appeared and no other implication shall be drawn therefrom.\n\n## SECTION 21.16. Execution on Behalf of Tenant.\n\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Lease or any other document attached hereto or executed and given to Landlord or Landlord's agent by Tenant in conjunction or connection herewith or the leasing of the Premises, each signatory hereto, when purportedly executing this Lease or such other document on behalf of a\n\n22\n\nG:\\Leases\\Andrea Winchester Square\\Orangetheory Fitness\\Lease v.5 11-17-17.docx\n\nCASTO\n\nDEPT.\n\nlegal entity (e.g., a partnership, limited partnership, corporation, limited liability company, or joint venture, etc.) whether domestic or foreign, warrants and represents to Landlord that, at the time of execution of this Lease, or such other document: (a) the named legal entity is in existence, validly created, in good standing and registered in accordance with all applicable laws in the state in which the Shopping Center is located; (b) the complete and correct legal name and entity designation of the entity appears as set forth in the first paragraph of this Lease; (c) the signatory is duly authorized to execute this Lease or such other document on behalf of the entity the signatory purports to represent in the capacity noted below the signature of such signatory; and (d) the correct title of the signatory appears below the signature of such signatory. Further, each signatory covenants and agrees that in the event any of the foregoing representations are found to be false as of the date of the execution of this Lease each signatory shall be personally liable to Landlord for the full and timely performance of all the undertakings and covenants and obligations imposed upon Tenant by this Lease, including, but not limited to, the payment of Rent and any other amounts due hereunder.\n\n## SECTION 21.17. Exculpation.\n\nIf, as a consequence of a Landlord default, Tenant shall recover a money judgment against Landlord, such judgment shall be satisfied only out of the proceeds of sale received upon execution of such judgment and levied thereon against the right, title and interest of Landlord in the Shopping Center or out of the consideration received by Landlord from the sale or other disposition of all or any part of Landlord's right, title and interest in the Shopping Center. No judgment rendered against Landlord shall give rise to any right of execution or levy against Landlord's other assets. No individual who is Landlord or any member or partner of any joint venture, corporation, limited liability company, tenancy in common, firm, partnership or other form of joint ownership that is Landlord, or their heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns, shall have any personal liability to Tenant, or to any person claiming under or through Tenant, for any amount or in any capacity. Such exculpation of liability shall be absolute and without exception whatsoever. Nothing in this Section, however, shall bar Tenant from seeking and enforcing any equitable remedy of Tenant against Landlord. Any such equitable remedy that can be cured by the expenditure of money may be enforced personally against Landlord only to the extent of Landlord's equity interest in the Shopping Center. In each instance in which Landlord's approval or consent is required under this Lease, Landlord shall not be liable for damages (whether direct, consequential or otherwise) by reason of its failure to grant such approval or consent (unless Landlord is found to have acted in bad faith), and Tenant's sole remedy shall be an action for injunctive relief or specific performance.\n\n## SECTION 21.18. Transfer of Landlord's Interest.\n\nIn the event of any transfer of Landlord's interest in the Premises, the Landlord shall be automatically relieved of any and all obligations accruing from and after the date of such transfer. In the event Landlord transfers any portion of the Shopping Center, Landlord shall have sole discretion as to whether such transferred property shall remain a portion of the Shopping Center or shall be excluded therefrom for purposes of calculating Tenant's Proportionate Share of Common Area Maintenance Costs, Real Estate Taxes, and/or Landlord's Insurance.\n\n## SECTION 21.19. Patriot Act Compliance.\n\nTenant represents and warrants that (a) Tenant and each person or entity owning an interest in Tenant is (1) not currently identified on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, Department of the Treasury (\"OFAC\") or on any other similar list maintained by the OFAC pursuant to any authorizing statute, executive order or regulation (collectively, the \"List\"), and (2) not a person or entity with whom a citizen of the United States is prohibited to engage in transactions by any trade embargo, economic sanction or other prohibition of law, regulation or executive order; (b) none of the funds or other assets of Tenant constitute property of, or are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by any Embargoed Person (as defined herein), (c) no Embargoed Person has any interest, of any nature whatsoever, in Tenant, (d) none of the funds of Tenant have been derived from any unlawful activity with the result that the investment in Tenant is prohibited by law or that this Lease is in violation of law, and (e) Tenant has implemented procedures, and will consistently apply those procedures, to ensure the foregoing representations and warranties remain true and correct at all times during the Term. The term \"Embargoed Person\" means any person, entity or government subject to trade restrictions under U.S. law, including but not limited to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. § 1701 et seq., the Trading with the Enemy Act, 50 U.S.C. App. 1 et seq., and any executive orders or regulations promulgated thereunder with the result that the investment in Tenant is prohibited by law or Tenant is in violation of law.\n\nTenant shall: (1) comply with all laws related to money laundering, anti-terrorism, trade embargos and economic sanctions, now or hereafter in effect; (2) immediately notify Landlord in writing if any of the representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this paragraph or the preceding paragraph are no longer true or have been breached; and (3) not use funds from any \"Prohibited Person\" (as such term is defined in the September 24, 2001 Executive Order Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions With Persons Who Commit, Threaten to Commit, or Support Terrorism) to make any payment due to Landlord under this Lease.\n\nTenant's inclusion on the List, or Tenant's active participation or complicity in the use or occupation of the Premises by any person on the List, or by any Embargoed Person, at any time during the Term, shall be a material default of this Lease. In connection with any proposed assignment of this Lease, Tenant shall provide Landlord with the names of all persons holding an ownership interest in any proposed assignee for purposes of compliance with Presidential Executive Order 13224 (issued September 24, 2001) as amended.\n\n## SECTION 21.20. Guaranty.\n\nIf one or more Guarantors are named in Section 1.01(X) hereof, Landlord's obligations under this Lease shall be conditioned upon receipt of a Guaranty of Lease in the form attached as Exhibit H executed by each named Guarantor and, upon request, receipt of satisfactory evidence of the authority of each named Guarantor to execute such Guaranty of Lease.\n\n23\n\nG:\\Leases\\Andrea\\Winchester Square\\Orangetheory Fitness\\Lease v.5 11-17-17.docx\n\nCASTO\nLEGAL\nDEPT.\n\n## SECTION 21.21. Security Agreement.\n\nTenant hereby grants to Landlord a security interest in all inventory, equipment, furniture fixtures, trade fixtures, improvements, and merchandise now or hereafter located in the Premises, and all proceeds and accounts receivable therefrom (the \"Collateral\"), to secure the payment and performance of Tenant's obligations set forth in this Lease. Tenant hereby appoints Landlord its true and lawful attorney-in-fact in its name or otherwise to execute and file any financing statement(s) on behalf of Tenant and to do any and all acts and to execute and file any and all documents which may be necessary to realize, perfect, continue, preserve and protect the security interest upon the Collateral. Upon the occurrences of any Event of Default, Landlord shall be entitled to exercise all of the rights and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code of the state where the Collateral is located. Reasonable attorneys' fees of Landlord in enforcing any right or exercising any remedy pursuant to this Section 21.21 shall be deemed a part of the obligations secured hereby.\n\nThe foregoing notwithstanding, and provided there is no then-existing default under the terms of this Lease, upon request, Landlord shall subordinate the security interest created by this Section 21.21 to the competing interest(s) of Tenant's lender(s) or creditor(s). Such subordination shall be memorialized via Landlord's form Lien Subordination in the form attached hereto as Exhibit I and which shall not be altered or amended in order to provide Tenant or Tenant's lender(s) or creditor(s) any rights above any beyond those contained in this Lease.\n\n## SECTION 21.22. Exclusive Use.\n\n(a) Exclusive Use. During the Term of this Lease, so long as Tenant has not been in default hereunder and is open, occupying and operating in the Premises in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Lease and solely for the Permitted Use set forth in Section 1.01(B), Landlord shall not lease space (or consent to the subleasing of space to the extent Landlord has such right) in the Shopping Center, to any tenant whose primary use is the operation of a membership based full-service fitness facility, indoor/outdoor boot camp-style, or instructional personal or group full-service fitness studio, or to a facility that offers heart rate monitored training (collectively, the \"Exclusive Use\"); provided, however, the Exclusive Use (a) shall not apply to the following: (i) any tenant with a lease that predates the date of this Lease whose use clause permits the Exclusive Use, and the successors, assignees and transferees of any such tenant (provided, however, that, to the extent Landlord is permitted to withhold consent to a change in use under such leases, Landlord shall not consent to any change in use under such leases that would violate the Exclusive Use), (ii) any tenant occupying at least ten thousand (10,000) square feet of GLA, (iii) any tenant that is permitted to use its premises for the Exclusive Use by operation of law, court order, bankruptcy, or similar action, (iv) any out lots, (v) any other premises not owned and operated by Landlord; or (vi) areas into which the Shopping Center may be expanded in the future; and (b) shall automatically become null and void (I) if Tenant shall be in default of the terms and provisions of this Lease and shall have failed to cure such default within the applicable time period under the Lease after written notice from Landlord informing Tenant of the default or (II) at any time that Tenant becomes a month-to-month tenant. The term \"primary use\" as used herein shall mean more than thirty five percent (35%) of a tenant's annual gross sales are derived from the Exclusive Use.\n\n(b) Remedy for Violation. If there is a violation of Section 21.22(a) above, then Tenant shall provide Landlord with written notice detailing such violation (a \"Violation Notice\"), which shall clearly state the specific violation, the trade name of the tenant allegedly operating in violation of the Exclusive Use, and the approximate date on which the alleged violation occurrence commenced. Landlord shall have ninety (90) days after receipt of a Violation Notice to cure the violation. If Landlord fails to cure the violation within such time period, then Tenant may, as of the first calendar month thereafter, as its sole remedy, pay in lieu of Minimum Rent \"Reduced Rent\" equal to fifty percent (50%) of Minimum Rent.\n\nTenant's right to pay Reduced Rent shall remain in effect until the earlier of: (i) the date the violation is cured, or (ii) the date on which Tenant provides notice to Landlord that it intends to exercise its Renewal Option, if at all; provided, however, that once Tenant has paid Reduced Rent for twelve (12) months, Tenant shall either: (i) re- commence paying full Minimum Rent beginning with the next succeeding calendar month, or (ii) elect to terminate this Lease by providing Landlord with written notice stating that Tenant has elected to terminate this Lease pursuant to this Section 21.22, which termination shall be effective thirty (30) days from the date of Tenant's providing written notice to Landlord, and which notice must be provided, if at all, no later than ten (10) days before the expiration of such twelve (12) month period. If the violation is cured prior to the effective date of termination, then upon Landlord giving Tenant written notice that the violation is cured, any notice of termination given by Tenant pursuant to the violation shall automatically become null and void and this Lease shall continue in full force and effect. In the event that Landlord disputes in good faith Tenant's contention that a violation of this provision has occurred, then Tenant's right to pay Reduced Rent shall not be effective until the dispute has been resolved by an independent third party mutually acceptable to Landlord and Tenant, the cost of which shall be paid by the non-prevailing party.\n\nNotwithstanding any contrary provision of this Lease, if any other tenant of the Shopping Center to whom the first paragraph of this Section 21.22 otherwise applies, without Landlord's consent or permission, commences operations in violation of the Exclusive Use (such tenant, a \"Rogue Tenant\"), then Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to cause such Rogue Tenant to cease such operations. Under such circumstances, Tenant shall not be entitled to the remedies described in Section 21.22(a) and Section 21.22(b), above, in connection with such Rogue Tenant's actions, it being the intention of this Section 21.22 to prohibit Landlord, and only Landlord, from affirmatively allowing other tenants of the Shopping Center to operate for the Exclusive Use (and not to hold Landlord responsible for the act of a Rogue Tenant acting outside of the terms of its lease). For purposes of this paragraph, \"Landlord's consent or permission\" shall mean the written or oral consent of Landlord given to another tenant of the Shopping Center to whom the first paragraph of this Section 21.22 otherwise applies, which consent allows such tenant to operate for the Exclusive Use, including, without limitation, Landlord's granting such tenant the right to operate for the Exclusive Use in such tenant's lease agreement or any modification thereof.\n\nG:\\Leases\\Andrea Winchester Square\\Orangetheory Fitness\\Lease v.5 11-17-17.docx\n\n24\n\nCASTO\nLEGAL\nDEPT.\n\n## SECTION 21.23. Tenant Improvement Allowance.\n\n(a) As an inducement for Tenant to enter into this Lease, provided Tenant is not then in default of any of the terms, covenants or conditions under this Lease required to be observed or performed by Tenant, Tenant shall be entitled to an allowance (\"Tenant Improvement Allowance\") equal to Thirty and 00/100 Dollars ($30.00) per square foot of GLA of the Premises, which Tenant Improvement Allowance shall be payable by Landlord as follows:\n\n(i) Fifty percent (50%) of the Tenant Improvement Allowance shall be due and payable within ten (10) business days following the Effective Date; and\n\n(ii) The balance of the Tenant Improvement Allowance shall be due and payable within thirty (30) business days after Tenant has delivered to Landlord all of the following: (A) Tenant's affidavit stating that (1) Tenant's Work has been completed in strict compliance with the Lease, Exhibit B and Tenant's Plans, including a breakdown of Tenant's final and total construction costs, together with proof, reasonably satisfactory to Landlord, of payment thereof, (B) completion of all Close Out Requirements as listed in Section V of Exhibit B); (C) final inspection by Landlord's construction representative confirming completion of all such required items, no security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code is outstanding or has been filed against any portion of Tenant's Work or the Premises (such affidavit may be relied upon by Landlord, it being understood that any deliberate misrepresentation or misstatement by Tenant therein shall constitute an Event of Default hereunder); (D) a completed Contractor's Affidavit from Tenant's general contractor, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit G (page 2); (E) an Unconditional Waiver of Mechanics' Lien in the form attached hereto as Exhibit G (page 1) executed by each subcontractor, laborer and material supplier who supplied materials and/or labor for Tenant's Work, or in lieu thereof, an attorney's certification that the lien period for the Tenant's Work has expired and no liens in connection therewith have been filed; (F) the certificate of insurance required pursuant to Section 9.01 (if not previously provided to Landlord); and (G) a copy of Tenant's Certificate of Occupancy for the Premises.\n\n(b) The Tenant Improvement Allowance shall be used exclusively for the purpose of the construction of Tenant's Work.\n\n(၁) The amount of the Tenant Improvement Allowance shall be deemed earned over the Term of this Lease on a straight line basis regardless of the manner or timing by which such Tenant Improvement Allowance is paid by Landlord to Tenant. If this Lease is terminated for any reason, prior to the expiration of the Term, Tenant shall promptly pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, an amount equal to the unearned portion of the Tenant Improvement Allowance plus interest at the Default Rate. If Tenant has not requested the Tenant Improvement Allowance in compliance with this Section 21.23 within twelve (12) months of the Commencement Date of this Lease, then Section 1.01(Z) and this Section 21.23 shall be rendered null, void and of no further force or effect and Landlord shall have no obligation to pay the Tenant Improvement Allowance to Tenant.\n\n## SECTION 21.24. Pre-Sales Premises.\n\nSubject to Legal Requirements and any restrictions in existing tenant leases, Tenant shall be permitted to temporarily use the vacant space shown on the Site Plan as the Pre-Sales Premises (the \"Pre-Sales Premises\"), to assist Tenant in pre-sales, membership and gift card sales, from the Date of Delivery of the Premises until the date which is one (1) week after Tenant opens for business to the public in the Premises. Tenant shall be permitted to add minimal furniture, such as tables and chairs, subject to Landlord's prior written approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Subject to Tenant satisfying, obtaining and/or complying with all Legal Requirements, Tenant shall be permitted to hang a professionally prepared, Landlord approved banner on the exterior of the Pre-Sales Premises. Prior to hanging, the design, content and method of attachment to the building for such banner shall be presented to and approved by Landlord. Promptly following Tenant's removal of said banner, Tenant shall, at Tenant's sole cost and expense, remove all hardware used to attach said banner to the building and repair and seal, to Landlord's reasonable satisfaction, all penetrations and any other damage to the building resulting from the attachment of the banner to the building and/or removal of related hardware. In no event shall such banner be placed in the Common Areas of the Shopping Center. Tenant shall only be permitted to use the Pre-Sales Premises during the Minimum Hours of Operation. The Pre-Sales Premises shall be deemed part of the Premises for purposes of Tenant's indemnification provision in Section 9.03 and Tenant's Insurance provisions in Section 9.01. Tenant shall not be required to pay Minimum Rent for the temporary use of the Pre-Sales Premises, but shall reimburse Landlord for the cost of all utilities or services used in, or specifically attributable to, the Pre-Sales Premises from and after the date on which Tenant first gains possession thereof. Tenant shall reimburse Landlord within fifteen (15) days following receipt of an invoice therefor from Landlord. Failure of Tenant to reimburse Landlord within such fifteen (15) day period shall be deemed an Event of Default. Tenant shall surrender the Pre-Sales Premises in accordance with Section 11.01 hereof.\n\nDuring Tenant's temporary use of the Pre-Sales Premises, Landlord or its agents shall have free access to the Pre-Sales Premises at all reasonable times upon prior notice to Tenant, except in emergency situations when no such notice shall be required: (a) for the purpose of examining the Pre-Sales Premises or to show the same to prospective purchasers and mortgagees; (b) for the purpose of showing the Pre-Sales Premises to prospective tenants; and (c) for the purpose of exhibiting the Pre-Sales Premises and putting up a \"For Lease\" or similar sign, which sign shall not be removed, obliterated, or hidden by Tenant provided that any such action by Landlord shall cause as little inconvenience as reasonably practicable.\n\n## SECTION 21.25. Tenant's Lease Contingency\n\nOn or before the Effective Date, Tenant shall apply for, or request, any required approval from the local jurisdiction for Tenant's Permitted Use and thereafter shall diligently pursue such approval using reasonable and good faith efforts. Landlord shall cooperate with such approval process by providing Tenant required documentation within five (5) business days of Tenant's written request therefor. Subject to all the requirements set forth in this Section 21.25, if, within sixty (60) days after the Effective Date (such date, the \"Contingency Date\"), Tenant has not obtained any required approval from the local jurisdiction for Tenant's Permitted Use, then Tenant may, by delivering written\n\n25\n\nG:\\Leases\\Andrea\\Winchester Square\\Orangetheory Fitness\\Lease v.5 11-17-17.docx\n\nCASTO\nIROAL\nDEPT.\n\nnotice to Landlord within ten (10) days of the Contingency Date, terminate this Lease.

This agreement supplements that certain lease agreement dated Nov 30 , 2017 by and between Landlord and Tenant for the Premises (the \"Lease\").\n\n\t1. Notices; Indemnification. Landlord shall give Franchisor copies of any written notices to Tenant of an Event of Default under the Lease simultaneously with the giving of such notice to Tenant. Such notices shall be sent to the Franchisor's address set forth in Section 1.01(A) of the Lease, unless an alternate Franchisor address is provided, in writing, to Landlord. Such notice will grant the Franchisor the right, but not the obligation, to cure any Event of Default, if the Tenant fails to do so, within fifteen (15) days after the expiration of the period in which the Tenant may cure the Event of Default under the Lease. Tenant agrees and acknowledges that a termination of the franchise agreement entered into by and between Tenant and Franchisor (the \"Franchise Agreement\") shall, at Landlord's option, be deemed an Event of Default under the Lease (such termination, a \"Franchise Agreement Event\"). Notice of a Franchise Agreement Event from Tenant must be accompanied by a copy of Tenant's notice from Franchisor of such termination to be deemed effective and Landlord shall be under no duty to acknowledge or investigate any notice it receives which is deficient or does not comply with the foregoing. All notices will be by nationally recognized overnight courier with parcel tracking and confirmation of delivery. Tenant shall indemnify and hereby agrees to defend and hold Landlord harmless from any and all costs, expenses (including attorney's fees), claims, suits, liability, damages, direct, indirect, or incidental, incurred or suffered by Tenant arising from Landlord's acts, omissions, or failure to act pursuant to any properly or improperly delivered notice of a Franchise Agreement Event.\n\n\t2. Option to Assume Lease. Franchisor shall have the right but not the obligation, to assume all of the Tenant's interest in the Lease by providing Landlord with written notice of such election within ten (10) business days following the date: (a) Landlord gives Franchisor notice of an Event of Default under the Lease, or (b) Tenant and/or Franchisor gives Landlord notice of a Franchise Agreement Event (such ten (10) business day period, the \"Notice Period”). If Franchisor exercises its right to assume the Lease, then Franchisor shall: (A) promptly following receipt, execute and return to Landlord, a commercially reasonable Lease Assumption Agreement prepared by Landlord; (B) pay any Assignment Fee due pursuant to the Lease; and (C) within ten (10) business days of Franchisor's assumption of the Lease, cure all then-existing monetary defaults, and commence and diligently pursue cure of all non-monetary defaults under the Lease. Franchisor's assumption of the Lease is contingent upon satisfaction of the foregoing obligations. If Franchisor elects to assume the Lease hereunder, Tenant's signature below shall indicate Tenant's consent to, and approval of the assignment of the Tenant's interest in the Lease from Tenant to Franchisor.\n\n3. De-identification of Premises. If Franchisor does not elect to assume the Lease hereunder, upon Landlord's receipt of this Addendum executed by Franchisor, along with a copy of the notice of termination of the Franchise Agreement and proof of insurance, Franchisor shall have the right to enter the Premises to remove all Franchisor's protected trademarks, service marks, and trade dress (collectively, the \"Marks\", depicted on Attachment 1, attached to this Lease Addendum and made a part hereof by reference).

Franchisor shall not allow its presence at the Shopping Center or entry into the Premises to interfere with or interrupt the business of Landlord or any other occupant of the Shopping Center.

Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to grant Franchisor any possessory rights in, or to the Premises. If Landlord does not receive written notice of Franchisor's intent to enter into the Premises to remove the Marks within the Notice Period, then Tenant's right to enter into the Premises to remove the Marks shall lapse, Franchisor shall be deemed to have abandoned any rights in, or to the Marks, and thereafter Landlord may remove and store or destroy the Marks at Landlord's sole discretion and charge Franchisor for any costs incurred in connection therewith.\n\n\t\ta. Repair of Damage. Franchisor agrees to repair, to Landlord's satisfaction, all damage to the Shopping Center, including, without limitation, the Premises, caused by or arising out of Franchisor's entry onto the Shopping Center and removal of the Marks. Landlord shall be entitled to condition Franchisor's entry into the Premises on Landlord's receipt of this Addendum executed by Franchisor and proof of insurance from Franchisor. Said repairs shall be completed at the time of removal of, and prior to completion of Franchisor's removal of the Marks, and within three (3) business days of Landlord's notice to Franchisor of any further required repairs.\n\n\t\tb. Indemnities.

Limited Third Party Beneficiary Right. Landlord agrees that for so long as Franchisor holds a collateral assignment of the Lease, Franchisor shall be deemed a limited third party beneficiary of the Lease, including, without limitation, this Addendum, but such third party beneficiary rights shall be limited to the right (but not the obligation) to enforce Landlord's obligation to give Franchisor notice of an Event of Default under the Lease. For clarification, no additional third party beneficiary rights shall be conferred upon Franchisor.\n\n6. Additional Provisions. This Addendum may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. A photocopy or electronic image of an original signature may be used for any purpose in lieu of an original signature. This Addendum, excepting Section 3 hereof, shall be valid and enforceable if executed by Landlord and Tenant.

The obligations and liability of either Guarantor shall not be discharged, released, affected or impaired by:\n\n\t\t(a) Bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, winding up or other proceedings affecting Tenant, or the disaffirmance or rejection of the Lease in such proceedings, regardless of whether any or all of the foregoing is or are done or made with or without the consent of Guarantors or Landlord;\n\n\t\t(b) Any modification, amendment or other alterations of the Lease; any renewal or extension of the Lease; any assignment of the Lease; and any sublease of all or a portion of the Premises (and Guarantors hereby consent to any and all of the foregoing); or\n\n\t\t(c) The cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of Tenant or any other party primarily or secondarily liable under the Lease.\n\n\t5. Until all Tenant Obligations are fully satisfied and discharged, neither Guarantor: (a) shall have the right of subrogation against Tenant by reason of such Guarantor's performance hereunder, (b) shall waive any right to enforce any remedy which such Guarantor now has, or hereafter may have against Tenant by reason of such Guarantor's performance hereunder, and (c) subordinates any liability or indebtedness of Tenant now or hereafter held by, or owed to Guarantors, or either of them, to the Tenant Obligations.\n\n6. In the event that this Guaranty shall be held ineffective or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, each Guarantor shall be deemed to be a tenant under the Lease with the same force and effect as if such Guarantor were expressly named as a joint tenant with Tenant.\n\n\t7. This Guaranty may not be modified, discharged or terminated except by an agreement in writing signed by Guarantors and Landlord.\n\n\t8. This Guaranty shall bind Guarantors and the heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns of each Guarantor. This Guaranty may be freely assigned, transferred or hypothecated by Landlord and shall run in favor and inure to the benefit of the Landlord, its successors and assigns, and each subsequent holder of Landlord's\n\nG:\\Leases\\Andrea Winchester Square\\Orangetheory Fitness\\Lease v.5 11-17-17.docx\n\n1\n\nCASIO\nLEGAL\nDEPL\n\ninterest under the Lease.

Each Guarantor agrees to be subject to action brought in such state, and to waive any objection to personal jurisdiction in such action. Each Guarantor waives all rights to a trial by jury in any action related to this Guaranty.\n\n\t10.

The undersigned further covenants and warrants that the undersigned is duly authorized by such Guarantor, by way of a binding resolution, action, vote or similar authority, to execute and deliver this Guaranty on behalf of such entity.

Within fifteen (15) days after Landlord's request, Guarantors shall execute and deliver to Landlord a written statement identifying this Guaranty and any amendments hereto and stating whether or not this Guaranty is in full force and effect and, if not, setting forth what reasons or legal defenses support Guarantors' claim that this Guaranty is not in full force and effect.\n\n\t13.

Nothing herein shall be deemed to preclude Landlord from obtaining service of process upon Guarantors, or either of them, in any manner permitted by the laws of the State of Ohio.\n\n\t14. Guarantor hereby authorizes and consents to Landlord's performing a credit check with and seeking other information as to any Guarantor hereof from any credit reference, prior lessor, credit bureau or credit reporting agency, as may be needed from time to time to monitor Guarantor's credit, to assist in collecting any monies past due, to facilitate a financing, refinancing or sale of the Shopping Center, or to establish, verify or confirm Guarantor's then current address.\n\n\t15. Guarantors hereby covenant that they have not and shall not transfer, convey, or assign any assets to an Ohio Legacy Trust as defined in Ohio Revised Code § 5816 as may be amended from time to time, or to any form of Domestic Asset Protection Trust.\n\n\t16. Any capitalized defined term used, but not defined herein shall be given the meaning ascribed to such term in the Lease.\n\n\t17. All of the foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, provided that, from the Effective Date of this Guaranty through the last day of the fifth (5th) Lease Year, Tenant has not been in default under the Lease, then commencing on the first day of the sixth (6th) Lease Year, Guarantors' total liability under this Guaranty shall be limited to an amount equal to the sum of: (i) all Rent due from Tenant to Landlord under the Lease for the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding to the date of default (the \"Liability Period\"), (ii) the unamortized portion of the Tenant Improvement Allowance, and (iii) the unamortized portion of any broker fees and commissions paid by Landlord in connection with the Lease. Any amortization calculated in connection with this Section 17 shall be calculated on a straight-line basis over the Term of the Lease, exclusive of Landlord's reasonable costs of collection and attorney's fees, and all of Landlord's costs, liabilities, fines, damages, penalties, judgments and losses arising from Tenant's grossly negligent or willful misconduct.\n\nWHEREFOR the following signature is made as of the day and year first above written.\n\nGUARANTORS:\n<signature>\n<signature>\n\nName: DEAN MCBURNEY\nAddress: 27 EALY CROSSING N.\nNEW ALBANY , OH 43054\nPhone: 614-207-6370\n\nName: GRETNA MCBURNEY\nAddress: 27 EALY CROSSING N\nNEW ALBANY OH 43054\nPhone: 614-446-6208\n\n2\n\nG:\\Leases\\Andrea\\Winchester Square\\Orangetheory Fitness\\Lease v.5 11-17-17.docx\n\nCASTO\nLEGAL\nDEPT.\n\n# EXHIBIT I\n\n# FORM LANDLORD LIEN SUBORDINATION\n\n# LANDLORD LIEN SUBORDINATION\n\nTHIS LANDLORD LIEN SUBORDINATION (the “Subordination”) is entered into as of the <empty> day of <empty> 201<empty> (the “Effective Date”) by and among <empty> (“Landlord”), with a notice address at c/o CASTO, 250 Civic Center Drive, Suite 500, Columbus, Ohio 43215; <empty> (“Tenant”) having a notice address at <empty> ; and <empty> (“Lender”), with a notice address at <empty>.\n\n## WITNESSETH\n\nWHEREAS, Landlord and Tenant have entered into a certain lease, dated <empty> (the “Lease”) which Lease is incorporated herein by this reference; and\n\nWHEREAS, the Lease grants to Tenant possessory rights in certain real property and improvements owned by Landlord and commonly known as:<empty> and as more specifically described in the Lease (the “Premises”), which Premises is located within the:<empty> Shopping Center (the “Shopping Center”), which Shopping Center is owned by Landlord and located in the State of:<empty>, County of:<empty>, and City of:<empty>; and\n\nWHEREAS, Lender has agreed to make a loan, lease or otherwise extend financing and/or credit facilities to Tenant (whether one or more, collectively, the “Loan”), which Loan shall be secured by, among other things, certain personal property, inventory, equipment, and trade fixtures (together with all replacements, proceeds, and products thereof) now or hereafter owned by Tenant (collectively, the “Collateral”); and\n\nWHEREAS, Lender has requested, and Landlord has agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of this Subordination, to subordinate certain rights Landlord may now have, or in the future acquire with respect to the Collateral.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Landlord, Tenant and Lender hereby agree as follows, effective as of the Effective Date:\n\n1. Landlord hereby subordinates its interest in the Collateral to the interest of Lender therein to the extent that Landlord now has or shall in the future acquire a superior interest in said Collateral by virtue of the above-mentioned Lease or pursuant to any so called “landlord’s lien” created by applicable common or statutory law.\nAnything contained in this Subordination to the contrary notwithstanding, however, this Subordination shall not affect Landlord’s right to obtain and enforce any lien which is subordinate to Lender’s security interest in the Collateral, nor shall it affect any Landlord lien against any property of Tenant which is not Collateral.\n\n2. Landlord shall give Lender prompt written notice of any event of default under the Lease which would result in a termination of Tenant's right to occupy the Premises. Lender shall be entitled to cure such event of default on Tenant's behalf, provided such cure is affected in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Lease, except that if such default is purely monetary in nature, then Lender shall have five (5) additional business days from the date of Landlord's giving of notice of such monetary default in which to cure such monetary default. Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, Landlord's failure to provide such notice shall not be a default under the Lease or this Subordination.\n\nLender shall give Landlord prompt written notice of any event of default under the Loan which would give rise to Lender's right to execute on, or remove the Collateral from the Premises. Should Lender fail to provide notice to Landlord pursuant to this Section, Lender shall not be entitled to remove the Collateral until such time as Lender shall be in compliance with said notice requirement. Any event of default by Tenant under the Loan shall be deemed to be an event of default under the Lease and shall not be subject to the notice requirement set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph of this Section.\n\n3. Subject to all the terms and conditions of this Subordination, if Tenant defaults under the Loan, or if Landlord affirmatively terminates Tenant's right to occupy the Premises (either occurrence a \"Default Event\"), then Lender may remove the Collateral or any part thereof from the Premises. Following a Default Event, Lender shall give Landlord at least twenty-four (24) hours' advance written notice prior to removal of Collateral. Lender shall use reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with, or interruption of the business being conducted at the Shopping Center by Landlord and other Shopping Center tenants and occupants. Lender shall be liable for and shall promptly, following invoice, pay to Landlord a sum equal to the rent provided for in the Lease (or the rent last payable by Tenant in the event the Lease has been terminated by Landlord) prorated for the period Lender is removing the Collateral from the Premises. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to grant Lender any possessory rights in or to the Premises.\n\nLender further agrees that after a Default Event has occurred, if the Collateral has not been removed from the Premises within twenty (20) days of Landlord's written notice to Lender directing removal, then Landlord may remove the Collateral and charge Lender for storage, repair and other costs of removal as a condition precedent to Lender's right to possession of the Collateral. If Lender fails to reimburse Landlord for any such removal, repair and storage charges within twenty (20) days of Landlord's giving of an invoice therefor, then Landlord shall have the right to sell all or a portion of the Collateral to pay for such costs and to otherwise dispose of such Collateral.\n\nG:\\Leases\\Andrea\\Winchester Square\\Orangetheory Fitness\\Lease v.5 11-17-17.docx\n\n1\n\nCASTO\n\nDEPT.\n\n4. Any contrary provision of this Subordination notwithstanding, in no event shall any property owned by Landlord; heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems; plumbing systems; electrical systems; utility systems; or other mechanical systems or fixtures be considered part of the Collateral and no such property, systems or fixtures shall be removed from the Premises by Lender.\n\n\t5. Lender shall repair any and all damage to the Premises caused by removal of the Collateral to Landlord's reasonable satisfaction and Landlord shall be entitled to condition Lender's entry onto the Premises on Landlord's receipt of such assurances and/or security as Landlord may reasonably require to ensure that any damage to the Premises is repaired by Lender. Said repairs shall be performed within three (3) days of Lender's removal of the Collateral from the Premises.\n\n\t6. Lender shall indemnify and hold Landlord harmless from and against all loss, cost, expense and liability (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees) resulting or occurring by reason of Lender's breach of the terms of this Subordination, entry onto the Shopping Center, and/or removal of the Collateral from the Premises.\n\n\t7. Any notices required or permitted to be given hereunder shall be in writing and sent by United States Certified Mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid or by an express mail or overnight courier delivery service that provides a return receipt, delivery service prepaid. Any such notice shall be addressed and directed to the party to be notified at the address stated herein or at such other address as a party shall designate by written notice as aforesaid. Any notice given as herein provided shall be deemed given as of the date of delivery or refusal.\n\n8. This Subordination shall continue in full force and effect until the earlier of the date: (a) Tenant has fulfilled all of its obligations under the Loan; (b) the natural expiration of the term of the Lease; or (c) if the Lease is terminated prior to the natural expiration of the term of the Lease, the date on which all of Lender's obligations hereunder have been fully discharged and satisfied.\n\n9. This Subordination supersedes and replaces any subordination documents previously executed by Landlord for the benefit of Tenant and/or any prior Tenant lender. Tenant represents and warrants that all prior loans, leases or other financing or credit facilities which were secured by all or any portion of the Collateral have been fully paid and satisfied and the Collateral released from any lien or security interest created in connection therewith and further represents that Lender is the only lender with respect to the Collateral. Lender and Tenant hereby agree and acknowledge that they will indemnify and hold Landlord harmless from and against all loss, cost, claim, expense and liability (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees) asserted by any prior Tenant lender as the result of Landlord's performance of its obligations under this Subordination in accordance with the terms hereof.\n\n\t10.

Guarantors, and each of them, further agree to indemnify and hold Landlord harmless from any loss, liability, damage or expense (including reasonable attorney's fees) arising from the failure of Tenant to perform any of the Tenant Obligations and/or the enforcement of this Guaranty. Upon Tenant's failure to pay or perform any Tenant Obligations, each of the Guarantors shall pay or perform such failed Tenant Obligations.\n\n\t2. Landlord shall not be required to pursue any remedies that it may have against Tenant or pursue other security or other parties as a condition to the enforcement of this Guaranty, it being intended that Guarantors' obligations hereunder shall be independent of, and in addition to, the Tenant Obligations. It is understood and agreed that Guarantors may be joined in any action against Tenant and that recovery may be had against Guarantors in such action, or in any independent action against each Guarantor or either of them, without Landlord pursuing or exhausting any remedy or claim against Tenant. This Guaranty shall not in any way be affected or impaired by reason of Landlord asserting against Tenant any rights or remedies reserved to the Landlord pursuant to the Lease, or available at law or in equity.\n\n\t3. Each Guarantor waives notice of any breach or default by Tenant under the Lease, notice of acceptance of this Guaranty, and all other suretyship defenses. The foregoing provisions shall apply, without limitation, to Landlord's waiver of or failure to enforce any Tenant Obligations and/or Landlord's granting extensions of time of performance to Tenant.\n\n\t4. This Guaranty shall be absolute and continuing. The obligations and liability of each Guarantor under this Guaranty shall continue in effect until all Tenant Obligations accruing during the lease term (including any renewal or extension thereof) have been fully paid, performed and/or satisfied. This Guaranty shall continue to apply during any holdover period or periodic tenancy arising subsequent to the expiration of the lease term by operation of law or otherwise. The obligations and liability of either Guarantor shall not be discharged, released, affected or impaired by:\n\n\t\t\t(a) Bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, winding up or other proceedings affecting Tenant, or the disaffirmance or rejection of the Lease in such proceedings, regardless of whether any or all of the foregoing is or are done or made with or without the consent of Guarantors or Landlord;\n\n\t\t(b) Any modification, amendment or other alterations of the Lease; any renewal or extension of the Lease; any assignment of the Lease; and any sublease of all or a portion of the Premises (and Guarantors hereby consent to any and all of the foregoing); or\n\n\t\t(c) The cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of Tenant or any other party primarily or secondarily liable under the Lease.\n\n\t5.

In the event that this Guaranty shall be held ineffective or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, each Guarantor shall be deemed to be a tenant under the Lease with the same force and effect as if such Guarantor were expressly named as a joint tenant with Tenant.\n\n\t7.
