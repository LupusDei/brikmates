Inthe eventthere is included in the taxes any special assessment or assessment which may be paid in installments, unless otherwise directed by written notice from Lessee, Lessor shall advise the appropriate governmental agency of its intention to elect payments in installments thereof, and Lessee shall pay such installments as shall be due and payable during the original term or any renewal term, regardless of when such installment was assessed, plus any carrying chargesorinterest assessed by the authorities for the privilege of paying over time.\n\nIn the event the Real Property is a portion of a larger tax parcel, Lessor agrees to use its best efforts to have the Real Property designated as a separate parcel\n\nBDOH04 Dublin - Tim's\n\n4\n\nfor taxing purposes so that the assessed valuation of the land and buildings shallrelate only to the land constituting theReal Property and to the buildings and improvements constructed on the Real Property.\n\nIn the event the Real Property is a portion of a larger tax parcel and the Lessor is unable to have the Real Property designated as a separate parcel for taxing purposes, sothat taxes are assessed upon the larger tax parcel of which the Real Property is a portion, Lessee agrees to pay that portion of the taxes which is reasonably attributable tothe Real Property, determined as follows:\n\nIn the event the taxes are identified or apportioned by the taxing authorities or are identifiable or apportionable based on valuation or other information furnished by the taxing authority so that the portion of the taxes attributable to the value of the land can be distinguished from the portion of the taxes attributable to the value of the buildings, then as to that portion of the taxes attributable to the value of the land, Lessee will pay a percentage of such portion of the taxes determined by dividing the area of the Real Property by the total area of the assessed parcel, and as to the portion of the taxes attributable to the value of the buildings, Lessee will pay a percentage of such portion of the taxes determined by dividing the gross floor area of the building on the Real Property by the gross floor area of all buildings located on the assessed parcel.\n\nLessor will notify Lessee in writing of any taxes which Lessee is required to pay or reimburse in accordance with the provisions of this Section. Except where Lessor has determined to advance pay such taxes and then seek reimbursement from Lessor such notification shall be furnished to Lessee not less than twenty (20) days before the date such taxes are due and shall be accompanied by a copy of the tax bill. Any taxes which Lessee is required to pay or reimburse shall be paid by it, through Lessor, no later than the date on which such taxes are due unless the notification by Lessor is received by Lessee less than twenty (20) days before the date on which such taxes are due or after Lessor has advance paid such taxes, in which event Lessee shall pay to or reimburse to Lessor such taxes within twenty (20) days after the date of such notification, and Lessor shall be responsible for the payment of any penalties, interest or other charges imposed upon delinquent payment of taxes. In the event the Real Property is a portion of a larger tax parcel, then the written notification by Lessor to Lessee of such taxes shall set forth (1) the total taxes on the larger tax parcel accompanied by a copy of the tax bill; (2) whether the total taxes on the larger tax parcel are identifiable or apportionable between land and buildings and if so, the amount of taxes attributable to the land and the amount of taxes attributable to buildings; and (3) Lessee's portion of the total taxes together with a statement showing how Lessee's portion was calculated in accordance with this Section.\n\nIf Lessee fails to pay or reimburse to Lessor any taxes which it is required to pay within the time period provided above, Lessor may, atits option, if applicable, pay said taxes, together with any and all penalties and said amount shall in any event become immediately due and payable as additional rent with interest at eighteen percent (18%) until paid.\n\nLessee shall have the right in its own name, or in Lessor's name where appropriate, but at its own cost and expense, to contest the amount or legality of any taxes which it is obligated to pay hereunder and make application for the reduction thereof, or any assessment upon which the same may be based, and the Lessor agrees, at the request and expense of Lessee, to execute or join in the execution of any instruments or documents necessary in connection with such contest or application. If Lessee shall contest such tax assessment, or other imposition, the time within which\n\nBDOH04 Dublin - Tim's\n\n5\n\nLessee shall be required to pay the same shall be extended until such contest or application shall have been finally determined, except that Lessee shall be responsible for any penalty imposed by the taxing authority resulting from the late payment of taxes due to said contest. Lessee shall escrow the amount of the taxes being contested in accordance with State law in order to prevent the lien for taxes being regarded as delinquent and shall pursue such proceedings only in a manner which will not allow the authorities to file for tax foreclosure.\n\nIn no event shall either party be liable for payment of any income, estate or inheritance taxes imposed upon the other party or the estate of the other party. Neither partyshall be obligated to pay any income, franchise, excise, sales or excess profits tax levied upon, required to be collected by, or assessed against the other party.\n\n## 6.

However, any transfer of this Lease from Lessee by merger or consolidation shall not require the written consent of the Lessor as long the surviving entity has a net worth equal to or greater than that of Lessee immediately prior to the transfer. Any consent byLessor to an assignment shallnot constitute a waiver of the requirement thatLessor approve subsequent assignments. Further, any assignment shall not modify the \"use\" clause of this Lease, nor shall it relieve Lessee from liability under the Lease, unless Lessee is specifically relieved by Lessor in writing in its consent in the assignment. Acceptance by Lessor of rent or other monies from a purported sublessee or assignee as to whom Lessor's written consent has not been obtained shall not bedeemed to imply Lessor's acceptance of or consent to such assignment or subletting (regardless of the number of occasions on\n\nas\n\nBDOH04 Dublin - Tim's 21\n\nwhich such monies are so accepted), and any monies so paid shall be deemed tohave been paid on behalf of and by Lessee forLessee's account.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, however, no assignment or sublease from Lessee to a subsidiary, affiliate or parent of Lessee or of Wendy's International, Inc. or to a franchisee of Lessee or of Wendy's International, Inc., for such franchisee's, subsidiary's, affiliate's or parent's operation of the Real Property as Wendy's and/or Tim Hortons restaurant shall be subject to any of the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph andLessee may freely enter into any such assignments or subleases, provided only that Lessee shall give Lessor notice of anysuch transactions and of the name and business address of any such franchisee, within sixty (60) days after the date of conclusion of such sublease.\n\nIf any assignment or sublease, other than one to a permitted assignee or subtenant as set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph, results in payments by the assignee or sublessee to Lessee of monies in excess of the monies due from Lessee to Lessor under this Lease, then fifty percent (50%) of the amount of the excess (after Lessee has first recovered, from the first such excess dollars coming in, its reasonable out of pocket costs and expenses incurred in obtaining such assignment or sublease) shall be paid by Lessee to Lessor as additional rent upon receipt of same by Lessee, provided, however, that there shall at monthly or other appropriate intervals be deducted from such excess and retained by Lessee, before the balance is split between the parties, such amount beyond the base rent as represents the depreciation, on a straight line basis and without interest, over the balance of the term from the date of commencement of said sublease or assignment, of the yet-to-be depreciated amount of Lessee's capital investment in improvements, furnishings and fixtures at and to the Premises, under a straight line depreciation schedule, assuming depreciation from the date of placement in service over the length of the Lease term.\n\n28. RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL:\n\nLessor covenants and agrees that in the event Lessor desires to sell the Leased Premises or any part thereof while this Lease remains in effect, Lessor shall require any prospective purchaser to submit a written, bona fide bid and shall notify Lessee in writing of Lessor's intention to sell at the price, and on the terms and conditions contained in such bid, and shall furnish Lessee with a true copy thereof. Lessee, for a period of fifteen (15) days from receipt of such notice, shall have the option of purchasing Lessor's entire interest upon the same terms and conditions as contained in such bid. In the event Lessee does not exercise such option to purchase, then Lessor shall have the right to sell the Leased Premises to such prospective purchaser upon the terms and conditions quoted in such bid subject to this Lease; provided, however, if Lessor does not sell its entire interest within one hundred eighty (180) days after the last mentioned fifteen (15) days, then Lessee's right of first refusal shall continue in full force and effect. Provided, however, that in the event that the Leased Premises shall be sold in accordance with above following a refusal by Lessee to exercise its option, then this right of first refusal shall no longer apply, except where the proposed purchaser is another fast food restaurant.\n\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the preceding paragraph, should any offer to purchase the Leased Premises made to Lessor or any successor in interest be part of a bid to purchase not only the Leased Premises but also all or any portion of the land adjoining the Leased Premises, then in such event, Lessee's right of first refusal shall not apply in such case, but shall continue on until such time as it may be proposed to sell the Leased Premises as an individual parcel.\n\nIn addition, in the event any conveyance of all or a partial interest in the Leased Premises by any individuals or entities constituting Lessor is made (a) to the family members, heirs, devisees or estates of, or to a limited liability company or\n\nBDOH04 Dublin - Tim's\n\n22 22 222\n\npartnership or corporation controlled by individuals constituting Lessor or any individual partner, principal, beneficiary or member of any entity constituting Lessor or to a trust controlled or created by individuals constituting Lessor or any individual partner, principal, beneficiary or member of any entity constituting Lessor; or (b) to a partner, principal, member or beneficiary, as the case may be, of any entities constituting Lessor, then this right of first refusal shall not apply in such case, but shall continue on until such time as Lessor or any successor in interest may propose to sell the Leased Premises as an individual parcel to a party to whom none of the exceptions made in this sentence apply.\n\n29. {INTENTIONALLY DELETED}\n\n30. {INTENTIONALLY DELETED}\n\n## 31.

NON-WAIVER:\n\nThe failure of the Lessor or Lessee to enforce any of the rights given to it under this Lease by reason of the violation of any of the covenants in this Lease to be performed by Lessee or Lessor shall not be construed as a waiver of the rights of the Lessor or Lessee to exercise any such rights as to any subsequent violations of such covenants, or as a waiver of any of the rights given to the Lessor or Lessee by reason of the violation of any of the other covenants of this Lease.\n\nNo waiver of any condition or legal right or remedy shall be implied by the failure of Lessor to declare a forfeiture, or for any other reason, and no waiver of any condition or covenant shall be valid unless it is signed by Lessor. No waiver by Lessor in respect to other lessees shall constitute a waiver in favor of Lessee, nor shall waiver of a breach of any condition be claimed or pleaded to excuse a future breach of the same condition or covenant. The mention in the Lease of any specific right or remedy shall not preclude Lessor from exercising any other right, or from having any other remedy, or from maintaining any action to which it may be otherwise entitled either at law or in equity. For the purpose of any suit by Lessor brought or based on this Lease, it is further agreed that any failure to include in such suit a sum then due shall not be a bar to the maintenance of any action for the recovering of said sums omitted.\n\n## 33. HOLDING OVER:\n\nIn theevent Lessee remains in possession of the Leased Premises after the expiration of thisLease and without the execution of a new lease, and Lessee has obtained Lessor's written permission to do so pursuant to written request tendered by Lessee at least one hundred eighty (180) days prior to Lease expiration Lessee shall be deemed to be occupying the Leased Premises as a tenant frommonth to month at a monthly rental equal to one hundred fifteen percent (115%) of the monthly rental provided for herein for the period immediately preceding the Lease expiration date and otherwise subject to all the conditions, provisions and obligations of this Lease insofar as they are applicable to month to month tenancy.

No part of the Shopping Center (including Outparcels), except Parcel I, shall be used as a food store or food department, or for the sale of meats, fish, produce, dairy products, bakerygoods or any of them for off-premises consumption, provided that nothing herein shall prevent the sale of such products as an incidental part of a business so long as the total number of squarefeet devoted to the display for the sale of such products in such a business does not exceed eight hundred (800) square feet, including one-half (1/2) the aisle space adjacent to any display area, except (a) one occupant of the Outparcels involved in the retail sale of gasoline and other petroleum products may have up to three thousand (3,000) square feet devoted to the display for the sale ofsuch products, including one-half (1/2) of the aisle space adjacent to any display area, and (b) the occupant of the Drug Store Space under the Drug Store Lease, so long as said Drug Store Space is used primarily as adrugstore, may devote up to six thousand seven hundred (6,700) square feet for the sale of such products, including one-half (1/2) of the aisle space adjacent to any display area.\"\n\nB. Lessor has seen and is familiar with the Tim Hortons and/or Wendy's restaurant business to be carriedon by Lessee on the Leased Premises. Lessee agrees that its restaurant businessdoes not and will not displayfor sale any of the above mentioned restricted products for off-premises consumption in a total number of square feet within the restaurantin excess of eight hundred (800) square feet, including one- half of the aisle space adjacent to any display area. While Lessor and Lessee do not believe the restaurant business to be conducted by Lessee on the Leased Premises violates the use restriction, they hereby agree to apportion the risk of a claim of violationof the use restriction between themselves as set forth in this Section. Lessor andOwner (by Lessor, its and their agent) hereby agree to indemnify, defend with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Lessee, protect, keep, save and hold harmless Lessee from any and all loss, costs, damages, claims, liability, suits, judgments, orders, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), penalties and fines (collectively, the \"Damages\") of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be incurred byLessee or claimed, brought or pursued or obtained against Lessee of whatever kind or character consequent or arising directly or indirectly from a claim of breach or violation of the above use restriction for so long as Lessee is constructing or operating a Tim Hortons and/or Wendy's restaurant on the Leased Premises. Lessor and Lessee agree that the total cost of the Damages arising out of a claim asset forthin this subparagraph B, shall be apportioned seventy-five percent (75%) to Lessor and twenty-five percent (25%) to Lessee. Lessee will cooperate withLessor in Lessor's defense of any such claim or suits and will be afforded the opportunity to participate in and be kept apprised of the progress of the defense of any such claim or suit. The foregoing indemnity shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.\n\nC. Furthermore, if aclaim ofbreach or violation of the use restriction results in a judgment or order of a court of competent jurisdiction which prohibits or\n\nBDOH04 Dublin - Tim's -\n\n29\n\nrestricts Lessee's operations such that Lessee determines, in Lessee's sole discretion, that it is being adversely affected in its ability to operate its Tim Hortonsand/or Wendy's restaurant business from the Leased Premises, Lessee may determine to cease operations of such restaurant business on the Leased Premises by written notice of such determination to Lessor, whereuponthis Lease will terminate and Lessee will be released from any and all further obligations under this Lease. Lessee's notice to Lessor will contain the date on which Lessee intends tocease operations, which date shall be not less than thirty (30) days after the date of such notice. If Lessee SO determines to cease operations, then on or priorto such termination date set forth in Lessee's notice: (i) Lessor shall pay Lessee the then book value (cost less depreciation) of actual, out-of-pocket capital costs incurred by Lessee in connection with the building and permanent improvements made to the Leased Premises by Lessee; and (ii) Lessee will: (a) pay to Lessor Fixed Annual Rental under the Lease, prorated as of such termination date on a per diem basis at one-thirtieth (1/30th) of the applicable monthly rate, together with all other charges due to Lessor under the Lease as of such termination date, and (b) return possessionof the Leased Premisesto Lessor. Upon payment to Lessee of the amount set forth in this subparagraph C(i), above, Lessee shall deliver to Lessor all instruments and documents deemed reasonably necessary by Lessor to convey title to Lessee's building and permanent leasehold improvements to Lessor or its agents or designees.\n\n## 50.
